This information helps you better understand how your marketing efforts affect your books’ sales performance. </p> <p>Amazon sales does not include orders related to Kindle Unlimited, Kindle Owners Lending Library, or Prime Reads. Sales data is currently available from November 2017, but check back regularly during the beta. We’ll expand the amount of historical data available, and you’ll be able to see both new sales and older sales.</p><p>You may notice that your Amazon sales may not match exactly your final sales in royalty reports from Kindle Direct Publishing or your publisher. This is because some orders that customers place do not fully complete, whether due to payment issues, cancellation, or other special circumstances. As such, if you see a discrepancy between your orders and your royalty reports, you should consider the information provided by your publisher or KDP as the official record of your total books sold.</p><h4>Using the Book Carousel</h4><p>When you first visit your Amazon Sales dashboard, you’ll see a graph of your Amazon sales. By default, your five most-popular books appear as their own lines on the graph, with the rest of your books grouped together as “Other.” </p><p>You can change the books you see in the graph by toggling the selections in the carousel—you can compare any five books in your catalog at a time. You can see more than five books in the graph by changing the number of books in the book selection tool above the carousel, but keep in mind that when you view more than five books, the additional books will always appear bundled into the line marked “Other.” You can see the performance of each of those books by selecting them to appear in the graph in groups of five.</p><h4>Using the Date Filter</h4><p>By default, your sales graph shows the most recent 30 days of activity. You can select any date range from the available data by using the calendar tool on the sales dashboard. Set your desired start date and end date, and the graph will update automatically.</p>","AA_Help_Pro_Author_Events":"<h2>Marketing Events</h2> <p>The Author Pro Marketing Events feature lets you track the promotional efforts you or your publisher take on behalf of your books.
