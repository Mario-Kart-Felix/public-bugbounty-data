by Rutger Arnhult, and asset management firm Coeli. The injection of cash will be used for continued geographical expansion and to accelerate the development of new products. Notably, this will include plans to launch in 10 new markets as Northmill aims to step on the gas. Next stop, Norway.<\/p>\n<p>As it stands, 2006-founded Northmill is available in Sweden, Norway and Finland, where it competes with incumbent banks with physical branches and the likes of Lunar, Revolut and Klarna (which operates as a bank in its home country of Sweden, and Germany).<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>More adjacent, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/02\/21\/anyfin\/\">another competitor is Anyfin<\/a>, which is similar to Northmill&#8217;s &#8220;Reduce&#8221; product, which promises to help customers consolidate their existing loans\/credit and lower their interest payments. &#8220;Our fastest-growing product and main driver today is Reduce, which lowers people\u2019s interest on existing credits, part-payments and credit cards,&#8221; explains a Northmill spokesperson.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"Yqb81bKvzO\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/08\/making-sense-of-klarna\/\">Making sense of Klarna<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Making sense of Klarna&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/08\/making-sense-of-klarna\/embed\/#?secret=Yqb81bKvzO\" data-secret=\"Yqb81bKvzO\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Founded nearly 15 years ago and originally operating as a credit provider, in 2019 Northmill secured a full banking license, regulated by the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority. The bank employs 150 people and offers savings, credits, payments and insurances. More generally, it has taken a different and slower path than most of the newer crop of challengers in Europe, relying less on investment to fuel its growth and claims to have been profitable from nearly the get-go.<\/p>\n<p>Cue statement from Rutger Arnhult, chairman of the board of M2 Assets Management: \u201cNorthmill Bank is already a profitable company with a proven and sustainable business model, which stands out among today&#8217;s tech investments. We have been following their journey for a while and have been impressed by the founders, as well as the company. The banking market is well on its way to change and the winners will be those who best can adapt to the new digital reality. For me, this is an investment in a tech company with long-term owners, who are just at the beginning of their journey.

Daily active users were up 77% year over year, to 36 million, while monthly active users were up 103%, to 134 million.<\/p>\n<p>Looking ahead, Zynga is forecasting revenue of $2.6 billion (a 32% year-over-year increase) and adjusted EBITDA of $450 million for 2021.

market, as the automaker seeks to win over customers by offering a variety of lower emission and zero-emission cars and SUVs.<\/p>\n<p>Two of the new vehicles will be all electric and one will be a plug-in hybrid, the company said Wednesday. Sales of the vehicles are expected to being in 2022.<\/p>\n<p>The aim, according to Bob Carter, TMNA&#8217;s executive vice president of sales, is to offer customers multiple choices of powertrain that best suits their needs. The automaker is developing and selling hybrids and plug-in hybrids like the Toyota Prius and Toyota RAV4 and fuel cell vehicles such as the Toyota Mirai.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The company said that by 2025 all of its Toyota and Lexus models will have an electrified option. The automaker is also developing a dedicated battery electric platform called e-TNGA that can be configured to meet different needs.<\/p>\n<p>This all-of-the-above approach is aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions and capturing more market share, which Toyota believes can only be achieved through variety. Toyota wants to have 40% of new vehicle sales be electrified models by 2025. By 2030, the company expects that to increase to nearly 70%.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We believe the fastest way to lower greenhouse gases in the transportation sector is to offer drivers lower carbon choices that meet their needs,&#8221; Gill Pratt, chief scientist of Toyota Motor Corporation and CEO of Toyota Research Institute, said in a statement. &#8220;At every price point and with multiple powertrains, we can put more people in cleaner automobiles across North America to have the greatest near-term impact on total carbon emissions.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The company&#8217;s internal research, which was <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/khamza075\/PVC\">built off of a tool<\/a> that\u00a0shows the trade-off between GHG Emissions and total cost of ownership, found that emissions of a currently\u00a0available battery-electric model and a plug-in hybrid model are roughly the same in on-road performance when factoring in pollutants created by electricity production for the average U.S. energy grid used to charge batteries.<\/p>\n<p>Manufacturing is a component of GHG emissions, Toyota noted. Researchers found that the production of a PHEV emits less GHG since it uses a smaller, lighter weight battery. The company also argued that plug-in hybrids are less expensive to buy and own, compared to a BEV.<\/p>\n<p>The company&#8217;s argument \u2014 that BEVs and PHEVs can provide similar environmental benefits \u2014 syncs up with its business plan. One of the BEVs will be Toyota branded and imported from Japan at the start of production, according to the automaker.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"pKfPK0JGwC\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/09\/audis-new-2022-e-tron-gt-is-a-real-electric-performance-sedan-not-just-another-electrified-crossover\/\">Audi&#8217;s new 2022 e-tron GT is a real electric performance sedan, not just another electrified crossover<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Audi&#8217;s new 2022 e-tron GT is a real electric performance sedan, not just another electrified crossover&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/09\/audis-new-2022-e-tron-gt-is-a-real-electric-performance-sedan-not-just-another-electrified-crossover\/embed\/#?secret=pKfPK0JGwC\" data-secret=\"pKfPK0JGwC\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Toyota Motor North America said Wednesday it will bring three new electrified vehicles to the U.S. market, as the automaker seeks to win over customers by offering a variety of lower emission and zero-emission cars and SUVs.

abroad?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>\u2014 Proactive in Pacifica<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Dear Proactive,<\/p>\n<p>Yes, I have many suggestions on what you can do to support international talent interested in moving to the United States. Immigration is a great benefit for attracting the best and the brightest team members from around the globe. And providing immigration security through visa practices and green card programs supports retaining these valued individuals. Consider sponsoring international students and other qualified candidates in the upcoming H-1B lottery in March.<\/p>\n<p>As it now stands, the H-1B lottery will be random this year, not pay-to-play. We anticipate the electronic lottery process will follow these dates:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>March 9 at 9 a.m. PST: H-1B registration process opens.<\/li>\n<li>March 25 at 9 a.m. PDT: H-1B registration process closes.<\/li>\n<li>March 31: You\u2019ll know if your H-1B beneficiaries were selected electronically in this initial round of the lottery.<\/li>\n<li>April 1: First date to file H-1Bs selected in the lottery to request a 10\/1\/2021 or later start date.<\/li>\n<li>June 30: Last anticipated day to complete filing of selected H-1B petitions in this initial round of the lottery.<\/li>\n<li>After June 30: Possibility of a second lottery for registrations submitted in March.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2100312\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2100312\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2100312\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg\" alt=\"A composite image of immigration law attorney Sophie Alcorn in front of a background with a TechCrunch logo.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"675\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg 1800w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=150,99 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=300,198 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=768,506 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=680,448 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=1536,1013 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2100312\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Joanna Buniak \/ <a href=\"https:\/\/www.alcorn.law\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sophie Alcorn <\/a><span class=\"screen-reader-text\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.alcorn.law\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">(opens in a new window)<\/a><\/span><\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Through the H-1B and other proactive immigration-support measures you can take, your international team members will enjoy a greater sense of immigration security. This allows them to focus on their job rather than worrying about their immigration status. Here are my recommendations for drawing international talent from abroad and fostering productivity and loyalty.<\/p>\n<h2>Establish your company&#8217;s immigration policy<\/h2>\n<p>I recommend working with an experienced immigration attorney who can help your company develop an immigration policy based on your company\u2019s core values, recruiting and immigration budget, and growth plan. Think of immigration as a benefit and a way to differentiate your company from others when recruiting top talent. Providing immigration benefits and immigration security goes a long way toward building team member loyalty and longevity.<\/p>\n<p>For some companies, the best policy may be to have no policy, but it\u2019s important to be deliberate about it and how that will affect your ability to make decisions and budget. For other companies, they implement a limited immigration policy to, for example, hire 40 engineers as soon as possible.

Playford, who grew up in the U.K., came to East Africa in 2007 to work on philanthropic biofield projects. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He ended up writing short-term loans to entrepreneurs, particularly in Kenya and Tanzania, and during this time formed the basis for which he as CEO and Rung as COO founded Pngme<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;That was sort of the impetus we needed and also the experience of being credit invisible in the U.K. led Cate and me to found the company <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">specifically<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> focusing on providing access to finance to Africans,&#8221; he said to TechCrunch<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Rung, the company&#8217;s initial thesis was that entrepreneurs didn&#8217;t get enough help, capital-wise<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. But g<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">oing into 2019, when the company raised its pre-seed round, the founders realized another problem &#8212; the lack of data infrastructure to access risk when giving out loans or capital<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Their stint in an accelerator based in Toronto, Canada helped to better understand the more valuable version of the company &#8212; the B2C layer which connects entrepreneurs with finance or the data infrastructure layer to understand risk or a person&#8217;s financial identity<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;We were building two different companies at once, so we had to choose one path. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We realised that the data infrastructure layer was critical and a massive pain point in most of sub-Saharan Africa,&#8221; the COO added<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pngme had to make a swift pivot to the latter. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Building this would have a much more significant impact.

The injection of cash will be used for continued geographical expansion and to accelerate the development of new products.

Next stop, Norway.<\/p>\n<p>As it stands, 2006-founded Northmill is available in Sweden, Norway and Finland, where it competes with incumbent banks with physical branches and the likes of Lunar, Revolut and Klarna (which operates as a bank in its home country of Sweden, and Germany).<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>More adjacent, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/02\/21\/anyfin\/\">another competitor is Anyfin<\/a>, which is similar to Northmill&#8217;s &#8220;Reduce&#8221; product, which promises to help customers consolidate their existing loans\/credit and lower their interest payments. &#8220;Our fastest-growing product and main driver today is Reduce, which lowers people\u2019s interest on existing credits, part-payments and credit cards,&#8221; explains a Northmill spokesperson.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"Yqb81bKvzO\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/08\/making-sense-of-klarna\/\">Making sense of Klarna<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Making sense of Klarna&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/08\/making-sense-of-klarna\/embed\/#?secret=Yqb81bKvzO\" data-secret=\"Yqb81bKvzO\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Founded nearly 15 years ago and originally operating as a credit provider, in 2019 Northmill secured a full banking license, regulated by the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority. The bank employs 150 people and offers savings, credits, payments and insurances. More generally, it has taken a different and slower path than most of the newer crop of challengers in Europe, relying less on investment to fuel its growth and claims to have been profitable from nearly the get-go.<\/p>\n<p>Cue statement from Rutger Arnhult, chairman of the board of M2 Assets Management: \u201cNorthmill Bank is already a profitable company with a proven and sustainable business model, which stands out among today&#8217;s tech investments. We have been following their journey for a while and have been impressed by the founders, as well as the company. The banking market is well on its way to change and the winners will be those who best can adapt to the new digital reality. For me, this is an investment in a tech company with long-term owners, who are just at the beginning of their journey.

fraud, is announcing that it has raised $7.5 million in Series A funding.<\/p>\n<p>The company was founded by CEO Inna Ushakova and CPO Yuriy Yashunin, who previously led the mobile marketing agency Zenna. Ushakova told me that while at Zenna, they realized that ad fraud had grown to the point that it posed a real threat to their business.<\/p>\n<p>At the same time, the team wasn&#8217;t impressed by any of the existing anti-fraud solutions, so it built its own technology. Eventually, they shut down Zenna completely and moved the entire team over to Scalarr.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The startup&#8217;s products include AutoBlock, which is supposed to detect fraud before the advertiser bids on an ad, and DeepView, which is used by adtech platforms (including ad exchanges, demand-side platforms and supply-side platforms).<\/p>\n<p>Scalarr says it can detect 60% more fraud than existing products on the market and that it saved its clients $22 million in ad fraud refunds in 2020. Ushakova attributed this in large part to the startup&#8217;s extensive use of machine learning technology.<\/p>\n<p>She added that while large ad attribution companies are adding anti-fraud products, they aren&#8217;t the focus.\u00a0And historically, companies have tried to detect fraud through a &#8220;rules-based approach,&#8221; where there&#8217;s a list of behaviors that suggest fraudulent activity \u2014 but no matter how quickly they create those rules, it&#8217;s hard to keep up with the fraudsters.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Fraud is ever evolving,&#8221; Ushakova said. &#8220;It\u2019s like a Tom and Jerry game, so they are ahead of you and we are trying to catch them.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>As for why machine learning works so much more effectively, she said, &#8220;Only ML could help you predict the next step, and with ML, you should be able to detect abnormalities that are not classified. Right after that, our analytics should be able to take a look at those abnormalities and decide whether something is statistically important.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Scalarr&#8217;s Series A was led by the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development, with participation from TMT Investments, OTB Ventures and Speedinvest. Among other things, the company will use the money to expand its presence in Asia and continue developing the product.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"BM23ji5t01\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/10\/3-adtech-and-martech-vcs-see-major-opportunities-in-privacy-and-compliance\/\">3 adtech and martech VCs see major opportunities in privacy and compliance<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;3 adtech and martech VCs see major opportunities in privacy and compliance&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/10\/3-adtech-and-martech-vcs-see-major-opportunities-in-privacy-and-compliance\/embed\/#?secret=BM23ji5t01\" data-secret=\"BM23ji5t01\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Scalarr, a startup that says it uses machine learning to combat ad fraud, is announcing that it has raised $7.5 million in Series A funding.

debuts a &#8216;link in bio&#8217; mobile website builder that helps creators make money, not just list links"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Today, there are a number of website builders aimed at creators who want to point fans to a dedicated landing page from their social media profile. If you&#8217;ve spent any time on TikTok or Instagram, you&#8217;ve likely come across one of these simplified &#8220;link in bio&#8221;-style websites &#8212; like those hosted by <a href=\"https:\/\/linktr.ee\/\">Linktree<\/a>, for example. A new startup called <a href=\"https:\/\/beacons.ai\/\">Beacons<\/a> is now entering this market with the goal of making &#8220;link in bio&#8221; websites even more powerful. Its website builder offers creators an expanded set of tools to monetize their community, including through donations, sales, paid requests, affiliate shopping and more.<\/p>\n<p>After signing up for the service, <a href=\"https:\/\/beacons.ai\/\">Beacons<\/a> walks the user through a series of questions, many which can be answered with just a &#8220;yes&#8221; or &#8220;no.&#8221; For example, Beacons may ask the user if they want to accept donations or collect followers&#8217; emails, if they make TikTok or YouTube videos, and which category they&#8217;re in, in terms of the content they create.<\/p>\n<p>This information is used to set up their Beacons landing page with the right content sections, which Beacons calls &#8220;blocks.&#8221; At launch, Beacons offers around a dozen of these configurable blocks, like email and SMS collection modules, video embed blocks for TikTok or YouTube creators, music blocks for embedding a track or album, a Twitter block to embed a tweet or Twitter profile, and link blocks, similar to Linktree, among others.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>There&#8217;s even a &#8220;friends&#8221; block, which is like a modern-day Myspace Top 8. This lets you link out to your friends on either Beacons, Instagram, Twitter or TikTok.<\/p>\n<p>An area where Beacons differentiates itself from other &#8220;link in bio&#8221; website builders, however, is with its set of &#8220;monetization&#8221; blocks. Today, it has four tools for creators who want to generate revenue from their online presence. One of these is similar to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cameo.com\/\">Cameo<\/a>, as it allows the creator to set up a menu of options to take fan requests for personalized content. For instance, fans could ask a fitness influencer to critique their routine, or they could pay to have their burning questions answered by someone they admire. The creator can then send out a personalized response either publicly or privately.<\/p>\n<p>Other monetization blocks allow creators to accept donations or sell digital downloads &#8212; like e-books or paid video content, for instance.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2111827\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2111827\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2111827\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/beacons-sites.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"341\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/beacons-sites.png 2524w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/beacons-sites.png?resize=150,75 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/beacons-sites.png?resize=300,150 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/beacons-sites.png?resize=768,385 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/beacons-sites.png?resize=680,341 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/beacons-sites.png?resize=1536,770 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/beacons-sites.png?resize=2048,1027 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/beacons-sites.png?resize=50,25 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2111827\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/beacons.ai\/gallery\">Beacons<\/a><\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>The fourth, and perhaps most interesting, monetization block is a TikTok shopping feature. It allows creators to embed their TikTok videos where they recommend products directly on their Beacons website.

Today, TikTok is only beginning to formalize its plans around e-commerce. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/629c1c17-3daa-46af-8177-1814baaa2bed\">In a recent presentation to marketers,<\/a> TikTok spoke of its plans to launch new online shopping tools that would allow brands to more directly reach TikTok&#8217;s younger audience. TikTok has also <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/27\/tiktok-invests-in-social-commerce-via-new-shopify-partnership\/\">partnered with Shopify<\/a> on social commerce, and has experimented with live video shopping, including with <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/17\/walmart-to-pilot-test-live-streamed-video-shopping-on-tiktok\/\">a holiday event hosted by Walmart<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"QcVH5ainLA\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/17\/walmart-to-pilot-test-live-streamed-video-shopping-on-tiktok\/\">Walmart to pilot test livestreamed video shopping on TikTok<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Walmart to pilot test livestreamed video shopping on TikTok&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/17\/walmart-to-pilot-test-live-streamed-video-shopping-on-tiktok\/embed\/#?secret=QcVH5ainLA\" data-secret=\"QcVH5ainLA\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>But TikTok&#8217;s creators have already been driving shopping trends across categories like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.vogue.com\/article\/how-tiktok-changed-fashion-this-year\">fashion<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/wwd.com\/fashion-news\/fashion-scoops\/tiktok-biggest-fashion-beauty-trends-1234684172\/\">beauty<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.whowhatwear.com\/tik-tok-home-decor-trends\">home d\u00e9cor<\/a>,<a href=\"https:\/\/people.com\/lifestyle\/viral-tiktok-finds-amazon\/\"> household items<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2020\/10\/16\/tiktok-is-driving-massive-toy-sales-during-coronavirus-pandemic.html\">toys<\/a> and much more, to the point that <em>&#8220;TikTok made me buy it,&#8221;<\/em> has become a common excuse for the impulse purchases prompted by TikTok&#8217;s viral content.

Neal, Jesse and David met while in the PhD program at Stanford studying different areas of research, like machine learning and AI. Greg, meanwhile, did his Master&#8217;s at Stanford, then went on to work at Apple on the Apple Watch team.<\/p>\n<p>Neal, Jesse and David had teamed up on Beacons and went through the Y Combinator Summer 2019 batch, iterating on ideas and pivoting the product several times. Some of those early concepts may eventually return &#8212; like a Shopify integration that would connect creators with brands selling on Shopify, for example.<\/p>\n<p>The broader focus, however, had always been on helping creators make money, says Neal.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Even before our current product, we were really focused on trying to help creators solve monetization,&#8221; he explains. &#8220;When we kind of made this mini-pivot into the more Linktree-like product, we thought about building features that can help creators actually generate revenue &#8212; which I don&#8217;t think Linktree or any of the existing incumbents in the space were doing. Even today, you can&#8217;t actually make any money through Linktree,&#8221; he notes.<\/p>\n<p>Linktree, of course, is only one of many &#8220;link in bio&#8221; websites on the market today, which means Beacons still faces <em>a lot<\/em> of competition. Other rivals include <a href=\"https:\/\/later.com\/linkinbio\/\">Linkin.bio<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/lnk.bio\/\">Lnk.bio<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/dash.shorby.com\/smartpage?&amp;lp\">Shorby<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/tap.bio\/@tap.bio\">Tap.bio<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/embedsocial.com\/feedlink\/\">Feedlink.io<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/linkinprofile.com\/\">Link in Profile<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/milkshake.app\/\">Milkshake<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/campsite.bio\/\">Campsite<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/bio.fm\/\">bio.fm<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/url.bio\/\">url.bio<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/biolincs.me\/\">biolincs.me<\/a>, for example.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube embed breakout embed--video\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/hM-HxQWYC1A?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'><\/iframe><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Unlike some of its competitors, Beacons offers its tools for free and instead monetizes through a <a href=\"https:\/\/pricing.beacons.ai\/\">premium plan<\/a> ($10\/mo) that allows creators to use their own custom domain. It also makes money by taking a percentage of sales on the requests and sales blocks, which is either 9% on the free plan or 5% on the paid plan. This rev share doesn&#8217;t bring in much money today &#8212; only &#8220;hundreds&#8221; of dollars &#8212; but the team believes that will scale as the startup grows and gains a large user base.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Our strategy is&#8230;to continue building out more of these different kinds of revenue streams for creators,&#8221; says Neal. &#8220;And as we do that, I think, the fraction of transactional revenue will become higher relative to the subscription revenue than it is today.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Since launching in private beta last September, Beacons has seen 90,000 sign-ups and now has over 20,000 people who are considered active users of the product &#8212; most arrived in the last couple of months when the service began to roll out some of its newer features. So far, Beacons hasn&#8217;t done any paid marketing, with around 77% of new users coming to Beacons because they saw it on someone else&#8217;s profile.<\/p>\n<p>The team raised a small, post-YC angel round of around $600,000 but is looking to fundraise in the future.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"7K1Fyha7Uw\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/26\/linktree-raises-10-7m-for-its-lightweight-link-centric-user-profiles\/\">Linktree raises $10.7M for its lightweight, link-centric user profiles<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Linktree raises $10.7M for its lightweight, link-centric user profiles&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/26\/linktree-raises-10-7m-for-its-lightweight-link-centric-user-profiles\/embed\/#?secret=7K1Fyha7Uw\" data-secret=\"7K1Fyha7Uw\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Today, there are a number of website builders aimed at creators who want to point fans to a dedicated landing page from their social media profile.

Image Credits: Eleanor Kagan<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>For in-person interviews not recorded in Pineapple\u2019s Brooklyn studio, my basic reporting kit includes a Zoom H5, which has two XLR channels and allows me to give one Rode NTG-2 shotgun mic to the host Natalia and the other to the interviewee. (On mic stands, of course \u2014 the mic itself is prone to handling noise.) I\u2019ve got a Rode pistol grip for when we, say, knock on doors in the neighborhood of the former Chippendales club in LA, looking for people who had been around when the party scene at the club was supposedly causing wars between the owners, neighbors and the police. (Luckily, we found Naomi, 94, who had been there since 1972 and had stories for days. She\u2019s in the podcast.) Christine showed me how she brilliantly uses a cross-body camera strap attached to her recorder so she can hang it comfortably around her. For gear bags I used to swear by the Lowepro Passport Sling, but now that I\u2019m older (lol), one-strapping isn\u2019t comfortable for a long day in the field, so I use a regular backpack. My kit also includes Sony MDR-7506 headphones, an assortment of three- and six-foot XLR cables (always have backups), a deadcat, extra SD cards, an Electro Voice RE50\/B mic, pens, snacks, release forms and batteries. So many batteries.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2111790\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2111790\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2111790\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Screen-Shot-2021-02-10-at-3.46.27-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"767\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Screen-Shot-2021-02-10-at-3.46.27-PM.png 1818w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Screen-Shot-2021-02-10-at-3.46.27-PM.png?resize=150,112 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Screen-Shot-2021-02-10-at-3.46.27-PM.png?resize=300,225 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Screen-Shot-2021-02-10-at-3.46.27-PM.png?resize=768,575 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Screen-Shot-2021-02-10-at-3.46.27-PM.png?resize=680,509 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Screen-Shot-2021-02-10-at-3.46.27-PM.png?resize=1536,1151 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Screen-Shot-2021-02-10-at-3.46.27-PM.png?resize=50,37 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2111790\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Producer Christine records historian Neil describing the LA neighborhood where the original Chippendales club opened.

We had done most of our interviews but there were a few we still needed, plus all the host tracking for the series. So we shipped Natalia a kit: a Zoom H6, a Shure SM7B cardioid dynamic announcer microphone, a CloudLifter CL-1 Microphone Activator, a broadcast arm, XLR cables and a windscreen. Natalia set up shop in her closet, surrounded by clothes, a fleece blanket on the floor, and as many cushions as she was willing to pull off her couches and chairs. (Sound bounces off of hard surfaces. The soft materials absorb it so the recordings won\u2019t sound echoey or \u201croomy.\u201d) We sent our amazing engineer Hannis Brown mic tests so he could diagnose the set-up from afar and suggest tweaks. And Natalia, bless her, was incredibly game to essentially become her own recording engineer ON TOP OF hosting an entire show. We quickly got accustomed to doing everything remotely and over Zoom, as all of us everywhere did.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2111791\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2111791\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2111791\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Screen-Shot-2021-02-10-at-3.47.44-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"975\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Screen-Shot-2021-02-10-at-3.47.44-PM.png 1348w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Screen-Shot-2021-02-10-at-3.47.44-PM.png?resize=150,143 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Screen-Shot-2021-02-10-at-3.47.44-PM.png?resize=300,286 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Screen-Shot-2021-02-10-at-3.47.44-PM.png?resize=768,732 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Screen-Shot-2021-02-10-at-3.47.44-PM.png?resize=680,648 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Screen-Shot-2021-02-10-at-3.47.44-PM.png?resize=50,48 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2111791\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Natalia\u2019s closet studio.

(We always recorded the Zoom as a backup too.) It was up to us producers to talk our interviewees through self-syncing. Experience and teamwork was of the utmost importance here. Interviewees only had so much time, and explaining how to set up a recording on a smartphone (or iPod!, yes, really) and transfer a test recording quickly, and then troubleshooting any audio problems in their location was important to getting a high-quality interview without taxing anyone&#8217;s patience. There are several useful guides and graphics out there that walk through the set-up. There\u2019s something a little bit lost, of course, when we don\u2019t get to walk into people\u2019s homes for interviews, or even when former Chippendales dancers can\u2019t produce their original costume in the middle of the interview \u2014 as one guy did. But everyone was incredibly kind and patient and willing to do this for us, for which we are very, very grateful.<\/p>\n<p>In the end, we interviewed about 70 people for this series.

Taking these technologies from &#8220;lab to market&#8221; requires substantial capital carrying a much higher degree of risk than an average venture investment.<\/p>\n<p>\t<div class=\"article-block block--pullout block--left\">\n\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\tThe majority of VCs are often surprised by the amount of complexity involved in building a successful deep tech company.\t\t\t\t\t<\/blockquote>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<\/p>\n<p>Typically, the underlying intellectual property (IP) of a deep tech company is unique and hard to recreate, resulting in a significant competitive advantage.<\/p>\n<h2>High risk, high reward<\/h2>\n<p>Since most deep tech companies are built around a fundamentally new and unproven technology, they carry higher risk. Typically, the tech has been tested in a lab or a research center and the early results are therefore often derived in a controlled environment. As a result, while building a product, founders are likely to encounter technical challenges along the way and won\u2019t be able to eliminate the technology risk until later in the process.<\/p>\n<p>By comparison, if a company is building a marketplace for used cars, for example, the technology risk is almost zero. Deep tech companies have the capability to create new markets with little competition and can replace existing technologies while fundamentally transforming an industry.<\/p>\n<p>Microsoft, Nvidia, ARM, Intel and Google were all deep tech startups in the beginning. These companies will almost always require higher capital, carry higher risk and have longer time to return on investment.<\/p>\n<p>However, if successful, they could deliver outsized returns over an average venture investment.<\/p>\n<h2>Technology-first approach<\/h2>\n<p>An obvious, but fundamental difference with deep tech companies is their technology-first approach. Typically, the founder has developed a novel technology or IP as part of their Ph.D. thesis or postdoc work and is in search for a real-world problem it can solve. Most startups, in general, pick an existing problem in a market they know well and develop a product that solves for that problem and they have a clear sense of the problem they need to solve.<\/p>\n<p>Deep tech entrepreneurs take the opposite approach and as a result they often suffer from SISP (a solution in search of a problem), as Y Combinator calls it. Founders need to be aware of this and must be willing to pivot and repivot based on market and customer feedback. Investors should be prepared for this before backing the company and support the founders as they navigate through the challenges of building a successful deep tech company.<div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Deep tech companies have the capability to create new markets with little competition and can replace existing technologies while fundamentally transforming an industry.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":133574325,"featured_media":2111819,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"outcome":"","status":"","crunchbase_tag":0,"amp_status":"","relegenceEntities":[],"relegenceSubjects":[],"carmot_uuid":"1639cec3-6cb8-363f-8609-89e78e20e77f"},"categories":[25515,446313605,20429,17396,35394854],"tags":[449559189,576846312,183],"crunchbase_tag":[],"tc_stories_tax":[],"tc_ec_category":[576796353,576796354],"tc_event":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/GettyImages-1227277358.jpg","shortlink":"https:\/\/tcrn.ch\/2Z7dUVX","rapidData":{"pt":"","pct":""},"premiumContent":true,"premiumCutoffPercent":0.45,"featured":false,"subtitle":"","seoTitle":"","seoDescription":"","tc_cb_mapping":[],"associatedEvent":null,"event":null,"authors":[2110250],"hideFeaturedImage":false,"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2110404"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2110404"}],"version-history":[{"count":8,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2110404\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2111822,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2110404\/revisions\/2111822"}],"authors":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/guest-authors\/vin-lingathoti"}],"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/edit":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-admin\/post.php?post=2110404&action=edit"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/tc\/v1\/users\/133574325"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/2111819"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2110404"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2110404"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2110404"},{"taxonomy":"_tc_cb_tag_taxonomy","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/crunchbase_tag?post=2110404"},{"taxonomy":"tc_stories_tax","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_stories_tax?post=2110404"},{"taxonomy":"tc_ec_category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_ec_category?post=2110404"},{"taxonomy":"tc_event","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_event?post=2110404"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]},"_embedded":{"authors":[{"id":2110250,"name":"Vin Lingathoti","link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/author\/vin-lingathoti\/","description":"Vin Lingathoti is a partner at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cic.vc\/\">Cambridge Innovation Capital<\/a>, where he focuses on technology investments.

market, as the automaker seeks to win over customers by offering a variety of lower emission and zero-emission cars and SUVs.<\/p>\n<p>Two of the new vehicles will be all electric and one will be a plug-in hybrid, the company said Wednesday. Sales of the vehicles are expected to being in 2022.<\/p>\n<p>The aim, according to Bob Carter, TMNA&#8217;s executive vice president of sales, is to offer customers multiple choices of powertrain that best suits their needs. The automaker is developing and selling hybrids and plug-in hybrids like the Toyota Prius and Toyota RAV4 and fuel cell vehicles such as the Toyota Mirai.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The company said that by 2025 all of its Toyota and Lexus models will have an electrified option. The automaker is also developing a dedicated battery electric platform called e-TNGA that can be configured to meet different needs.<\/p>\n<p>This all-of-the-above approach is aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions and capturing more market share, which Toyota believes can only be achieved through variety. Toyota wants to have 40% of new vehicle sales be electrified models by 2025. By 2030, the company expects that to increase to nearly 70%.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We believe the fastest way to lower greenhouse gases in the transportation sector is to offer drivers lower carbon choices that meet their needs,&#8221; Gill Pratt, chief scientist of Toyota Motor Corporation and CEO of Toyota Research Institute, said in a statement. &#8220;At every price point and with multiple powertrains, we can put more people in cleaner automobiles across North America to have the greatest near-term impact on total carbon emissions.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The company&#8217;s internal research, which was <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/khamza075\/PVC\">built off of a tool<\/a> that\u00a0shows the trade-off between GHG Emissions and total cost of ownership, found that emissions of a currently\u00a0available battery-electric model and a plug-in hybrid model are roughly the same in on-road performance when factoring in pollutants created by electricity production for the average U.S. energy grid used to charge batteries.<\/p>\n<p>Manufacturing is a component of GHG emissions, Toyota noted. Researchers found that the production of a PHEV emits less GHG since it uses a smaller, lighter weight battery. The company also argued that plug-in hybrids are less expensive to buy and own, compared to a BEV.<\/p>\n<p>The company&#8217;s argument \u2014 that BEVs and PHEVs can provide similar environmental benefits \u2014 syncs up with its business plan.

But not every deal involves a huge price tag. Today we are going to look at three smaller deals that show there is plenty of activity at the lower-end of the acquisition spectrum.<\/p>\n<p>As companies look for ways to enhance their offerings, and bring in some talent at the same time, smaller acquisitions can provide a way to fill in the product road map without having to build everything in-house.<\/p>\n<p>This gives acquiring companies additional functionality for a modest amount of cash. In smaller deals, we often don&#8217;t even get the dollar amount, although in one case today we did. If the deal isn&#8217;t large enough to have a material financial impact on a publicly traded company, they don&#8217;t have to share the price.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Let&#8217;s have a look at three such deals that came through in recent days.<\/p>\n<h2>Tenable buys Alsid<\/h2>\n<p>For starters, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tenable.com\/\">Tenable<\/a>, a network security company that went public in 2018, bought French Active Directory security startup <a href=\"https:\/\/www.alsid.com\/\">Alsid<\/a> for $98 million. Active Directory, Microsoft&#8217;s popular user management tool, is also a target of hackers. If they can get a user&#8217;s credentials, it&#8217;s an easy way to get on the network and Alsid is designed to prevent that.<\/p>\n<p>Security companies tend to enhance the breadth of their offerings over time and Alsid gives Tenable another tool and broader coverage across their security platform. &#8220;We view the acquisition of Alsid as a natural extension into user access and permissioning. Once completed, this acquisition will be a strategic complement to our Cyber Exposure vision to help organizations understand and reduce cyber risk across the entire attack surface,&#8221; according to the<a href=\"https:\/\/investors.tenable.com\/investor-resources\/investor-faqs\"> investor FAQ on this acquisition<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Emmanuel Gras, CEO and co-founder, Alsid says he started the company to prevent this kind of attack. &#8220;We started Alsid to help organizations solve one of the biggest security challenges, an unprotected Active Directory, which is one of the most common ways for threat actors to move laterally across enterprise systems,&#8221; Gras said in a statement.<\/p>\n<p>Alsid is based in Paris and was founded in 2014. It raised a modest amount, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/04\/17\/alsid-raises-14-7-million-to-secure-your-active-directory-installation\/\">approximately $15,000<\/a>, according to Crunchbase data.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"o8yhrKn0oy\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/08\/container-security-acquisitions-increase-as-companies-accelerate-shift-to-cloud\/\">Container security acquisitions increase as companies accelerate shift to cloud<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Container security acquisitions increase as companies accelerate shift to cloud&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/08\/container-security-acquisitions-increase-as-companies-accelerate-shift-to-cloud\/embed\/#?secret=o8yhrKn0oy\" data-secret=\"o8yhrKn0oy\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<h2>Copper acquires Sherlock<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.copper.com\/\">Copper<\/a>, a CRM tool built on top of the Google Workspace, announced it has purchased <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sherlockscore.com\/\">Sherlock<\/a>, a customer experience platform.

company and are planning to make a more concerted effort to recruit internationally. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you have suggestions for attracting workers from abroad?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>\u2014 Proactive in Pacifica<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Dear Proactive,<\/p>\n<p>Yes, I have many suggestions on what you can do to support international talent interested in moving to the United States. Immigration is a great benefit for attracting the best and the brightest team members from around the globe. And providing immigration security through visa practices and green card programs supports retaining these valued individuals. Consider sponsoring international students and other qualified candidates in the upcoming H-1B lottery in March.<\/p>\n<p>As it now stands, the H-1B lottery will be random this year, not pay-to-play. We anticipate the electronic lottery process will follow these dates:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>March 9 at 9 a.m. PST: H-1B registration process opens.<\/li>\n<li>March 25 at 9 a.m. PDT: H-1B registration process closes.<\/li>\n<li>March 31: You\u2019ll know if your H-1B beneficiaries were selected electronically in this initial round of the lottery.<\/li>\n<li>April 1: First date to file H-1Bs selected in the lottery to request a 10\/1\/2021 or later start date.<\/li>\n<li>June 30: Last anticipated day to complete filing of selected H-1B petitions in this initial round of the lottery.<\/li>\n<li>After June 30: Possibility of a second lottery for registrations submitted in March.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2100312\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2100312\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2100312\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg\" alt=\"A composite image of immigration law attorney Sophie Alcorn in front of a background with a TechCrunch logo.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"675\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg 1800w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=150,99 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=300,198 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=768,506 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=680,448 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=1536,1013 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2100312\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Joanna Buniak \/ <a href=\"https:\/\/www.alcorn.law\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sophie Alcorn <\/a><span class=\"screen-reader-text\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.alcorn.law\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">(opens in a new window)<\/a><\/span><\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Through the H-1B and other proactive immigration-support measures you can take, your international team members will enjoy a greater sense of immigration security. This allows them to focus on their job rather than worrying about their immigration status. Here are my recommendations for drawing international talent from abroad and fostering productivity and loyalty.<\/p>\n<h2>Establish your company&#8217;s immigration policy<\/h2>\n<p>I recommend working with an experienced immigration attorney who can help your company develop an immigration policy based on your company\u2019s core values, recruiting and immigration budget, and growth plan. Think of immigration as a benefit and a way to differentiate your company from others when recruiting top talent. Providing immigration benefits and immigration security goes a long way toward building team member loyalty and longevity.<\/p>\n<p>For some companies, the best policy may be to have no policy, but it\u2019s important to be deliberate about it and how that will affect your ability to make decisions and budget. For other companies, they implement a limited immigration policy to, for example, hire 40 engineers as soon as possible. Even with a decentralized workforce, a new recruit may be happy to move from Ukraine to Idaho even if your company is not based there.<div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Step one: establish your company&#8217;s immigration policy.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":133574325,"featured_media":2099516,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"outcome":"","status":"","crunchbase_tag":0,"amp_status":"","relegenceEntities":[],"relegenceSubjects":[],"carmot_uuid":"22498e17-70b3-3771-b966-2f344e2b6628"},"categories":[25515,35027640,576818242,13217,20429],"tags":[576846312,576846278,576666437,449558381,576726866,576682130],"crunchbase_tag":[],"tc_stories_tax":[],"tc_ec_category":[576796357],"tc_event":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/dear-sophie-immigration-maze-3.jpg","shortlink":"https:\/\/tcrn.ch\/2NcgrvA","rapidData":{"pt":"","pct":""},"premiumContent":true,"premiumCutoffPercent":0.57,"featured":false,"subtitle":"","seoTitle":"","seoDescription":"","tc_cb_mapping":[],"associatedEvent":null,"event":null,"authors":[1851211],"hideFeaturedImage":false,"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2111722"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2111722"}],"version-history":[{"count":6,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2111722\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2111814,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2111722\/revisions\/2111814"}],"authors":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/guest-authors\/sophie-alcorn"}],"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/edit":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-admin\/post.php?post=2111722&action=edit"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/tc\/v1\/users\/133574325"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/2099516"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2111722"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2111722"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2111722"},{"taxonomy":"_tc_cb_tag_taxonomy","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/crunchbase_tag?post=2111722"},{"taxonomy":"tc_stories_tax","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_stories_tax?post=2111722"},{"taxonomy":"tc_ec_category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_ec_category?post=2111722"},{"taxonomy":"tc_event","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_event?post=2111722"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]},"_embedded":{"authors":[{"id":1851211,"name":"Sophie Alcorn","link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/author\/sophie-alcorn\/","description":"<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Sophie_Alcorn\">Sophie Alcorn<\/a> is the founder of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.alcorn.law\/\">Alcorn Immigration Law<\/a> in Silicon Valley and 2019 Global Law Experts Awards\u2019 \u201cLaw Firm of the Year in California for Entrepreneur Immigration Services.\u201d She connects people with the businesses and opportunities that expand their lives.","slug":"sophie-alcorn","links":{"twitter":"Sophie_Alcorn"},"position":"Contributor","cbDescription":"<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Sophie_Alcorn\">Sophie Alcorn<\/a> is the founder of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.alcorn.law\/\">Alcorn Immigration Law<\/a> in Silicon Valley and 2019 Global Law Experts Awards\u2019 \u201cLaw Firm of the Year in California for Entrepreneur Immigration Services.\u201d She connects people with the businesses and opportunities that expand their lives.","cbAvatar":"","twitter":"Sophie_Alcorn"}],"author":[{"id":133574325,"name":"Walter Thompson","url":"https:\/\/anchor.fm\/thegoldencity","description":"Senior Editor Walter Thompson manages Extra Crunch and TechCrunch's guest post program. \r\n\r\nPreviously, he worked at a number of startups in various roles and as City Editor of Hoodline.

Epic today <a href=\"https:\/\/www.unrealengine.com\/en-US\/blog\/a-sneak-peek-at-metahuman-creator-high-fidelity-digital-humans-made-easy\">showed off a new character creation tool<\/a> in Unreal Engine that lets you make a near-infinite variety of near-photorealistic digital people with far less effort than it might have taken before.<\/p>\n<p>MetaHuman Creator is an application for designing characters that lets people mix and match presets then dive into the tiniest details. It&#8217;s a cloud-hosted service, since the amount of computing power and storage needed to render these characters at this resolution and level of lighting and so on is more than most people will have on hand.<\/p>\n<p>Anyone who&#8217;s used a high-quality character creator will recognize the pieces \u2014 a few dozen hairstyles, ear types, beards and lip shapes, which can be added, subtracted and adjusted like a digital Mr. Potato Head.

As you can see in the videos, the quality of the hair, skin, eyes, teeth and so on is extremely high \u2014 the older fellow on the left has quite realistic wrinkles that shadow and deform properly when he moves his face, and the way the light interacts with the center lady&#8217;s light skin is very different from that of the dark-skinned man on the right.<\/p>\n<p>The &#8220;center lady&#8221; also started as a middle-aged man and was sculpted piece by piece to her current look rather than just switching to a &#8220;feminine&#8221; preset, demonstrating that the faces don&#8217;t &#8220;break&#8221; if you manipulate them too much \u2014 a risk in other creators for sure. You can see the process in fast-forward in the video below:<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube embed breakout embed--video\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/S3F1vZYpH8c?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'><\/iframe><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Naturally it also integrates with the usual creator tools, allowing for animation by various means, fiddling with meshes and exporting for use in other tools.<\/p>\n<p>This level of detail isn&#8217;t exactly unprecedented, but the amount of work that goes into rendering a main character good enough for extreme close-ups and microexpressions is huge. Epic&#8217;s approach is not just to increase the potential quality of the assets and lighting and so on but to make it easy and efficient to implement. If only AAA studios can muster the resources to make characters like this, it&#8217;s not healthy for gaming as a whole.<\/p>\n<p>Epic was humble enough to give credit right off the bat to companies like 3Lateral and Cubic Motion, both specialists in the field it has acquired. The Unreal Engine is presented as a sort of monolithic advance in computer graphics and design, but really it&#8217;s a very cleverly assembled amalgamation of dozens of improvements and advances made by individual (now acquired) companies and divisions over the years \u2014 more like an operating system with a bunch of integrated applications at this point.<\/p>\n<p>MetaHuman Creator isn&#8217;t quite ready for use by just anyone, but Epic is running an early-access program you can sign up for, and they&#8217;ve provided a pair of models for you to play with in your existing Unreal Engine environment in the meantime (check the &#8220;Learn&#8221; tab).<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"nfrbwD2xSL\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/07\/epic-acquires-rad-game-tools-veteran-of-many-gaming-generations\/\">Epic acquires Rad Game Tools, veteran of many gaming generations<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Epic acquires Rad Game Tools, veteran of many gaming generations&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/07\/epic-acquires-rad-game-tools-veteran-of-many-gaming-generations\/embed\/#?secret=nfrbwD2xSL\" data-secret=\"nfrbwD2xSL\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>One of the most difficult tasks in the increasingly high-fidelity world of gaming is making realistic-looking people \u2014 especially faces.

The idea is to take an app&#8217;s user acquisition, engagement, monetization and sentiment and boil them down into a single score that benchmarks how the app is performing relative to the competition.<\/p>\n<p>Krantz said that eventually, the performance store could become more customizable for each customer, so that \u00a0&#8220;you can tailor it to the metrics that matter to you.&#8221; The app also highlights any shifts in key app metrics and identifies potential causes, and it includes a newsfeed showing what&#8217;s happening to the apps and markets that a user follows.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2111714\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2111714\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2111714\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Performance_Score_v3_TightCropped_withText_gap-1024x945-1.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"App Annie Pulse\" width=\"680\" height=\"628\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Performance_Score_v3_TightCropped_withText_gap-1024x945-1.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Performance_Score_v3_TightCropped_withText_gap-1024x945-1.jpg?resize=150,138 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Performance_Score_v3_TightCropped_withText_gap-1024x945-1.jpg?resize=300,277 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Performance_Score_v3_TightCropped_withText_gap-1024x945-1.jpg?resize=768,709 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Performance_Score_v3_TightCropped_withText_gap-1024x945-1.jpg?resize=680,628 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Performance_Score_v3_TightCropped_withText_gap-1024x945-1.jpg?resize=50,46 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2111714\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> App Annie<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>The goal, Krantz added, is to provide executives with a quick overview of the data they need without requiring them to dig through it or wait for a report \u2014 especially as &#8220;mobile is becoming such an imperative.&#8221; It&#8217;s the team&#8217;s &#8220;aspiration&#8221; to create an app that executives check every day, though he&#8217;s not necessarily expecting that to happen initially.<\/p>\n<p>The Pulse app is based on App Annie&#8217;s market-level data, so Krantz said it shouldn&#8217;t be affected by <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/27\/apple-app-tracking-transparency\/\">Apple&#8217;s upcoming privacy changes<\/a>. At the same time, he acknowledged that the company&#8217;s broader goals of <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/14\/app-annie-ascend\/\">bringing together first-party and third-party data<\/a> are starting too look &#8220;a little tricky.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>App Annie Pulse is currently available on iOS, with the company planning to launch an Android version in the second quarter of this year.

pilot program<\/a> designed to see if they can help supplement efforts to keep these mission-critical personnel healthy ahead of key space missions. The program will see NASA employees outfitted with a wearable and provided access to a daily check-in app they can use to log potential symptoms, as well as their body temperature and other key health metrics, which could potentially help spot developing cases.<\/p>\n<p>NASA has already been taking measures to isolate astronauts and to limit or prevent the spread of COVID-19 across its facilities, which are located across the U.S. It has of course followed local guidelines and requirements regarding COVID-19 protections, but it also introduced its own level-based system last year and implemented remote work protocols for many employees wherever possible. On the astronaut side, it has also beefed up existing isolation and sequestration procedures that are already quite strict in order to guarantee that its spacefarers don&#8217;t get sick before they&#8217;re set to make a trip to the International Space Station.<\/p>\n<p>The new Fitbit program is designed to supplement those existing measures, providing tracked health metrics including resting heart rate and heart rate variability, as well as respiratory rate, changes in all of which have been linked to COVID-19. Those stats, along with the self-reported metrics logged by users themselves, including any reports of potential symptoms, will be used by the app to provide individuals in the program with guidance about whether they should go into work, or stay home and take additional measures to find out if they have COVID-19.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Fitbit is already engaged in studies to determine whether its wearable devices and the metrics they log can be useful in providing early COVID-19 detection. Regardless of those results, self-reporting as well as the baseline health metrics that the app logs from its devices are already likely to be handy in providing a supplement to existing self-assessment measures regarding the level of risk you pose to others if you&#8217;re feeling off, which is the primary purpose of this program with NASA.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"JFTqz5JFPW\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/08\/28\/fitbits-ceo-discusses-the-companys-subscription-future\/\">Fitbit&#8217;s CEO discusses the company&#8217;s subscription future<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Fitbit&#8217;s CEO discusses the company&#8217;s subscription future&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/08\/28\/fitbits-ceo-discusses-the-companys-subscription-future\/embed\/#?secret=JFTqz5JFPW\" data-secret=\"JFTqz5JFPW\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>NASA will provide 1,000 of its employees, including 150 astronauts, with Fitbit devices in a pilot program designed to see if they can help supplement efforts to keep these mission-critical personnel healthy ahead of key space missions.

(Facebook&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/23\/facebook-denies-it-will-pull-service-in-europe-over-data-transfer-ban\/\">Nick Clegg will be clutching his pearls<\/a>.)<\/p>\n<p>More recently, the CEO of European publishing giant Axel Springer, a longtime co-conspirator of adtech interests, went public with a (rather protectionist-flavored) rant about U.S.-based data-mining tech platforms turning citizens into &#8220;the marionettes of capitalist monopolies&#8221; &#8212; calling for EU lawmakers to extend regional privacy rules by prohibiting platforms from storing personal data and using it for commercial gain <em>at all<\/em>.<\/p>\n<div id=\"gpt-post-opinion-desktop_in_post_ad-desktop-8\" class=\"ad ad-wrapper fluid in-post only-desktop is-collapsible collapsed\" data-bi-ad=\"\" data-force=\"\" data-type=\"ad\" data-adunit=\"news\/opinion\/post\" data-secvert=\"politics,sai\" data-pagetype=\"post\" data-tag=\"opinion,bi-commentary,user-data,big-tech,facebook,google,apple,europe,china\" data-authors=\"mathias-dpfner\" data-region=\"Desktop In Post Ad\" data-responsive=\"[{&quot;browserLimit&quot;:[728,0],&quot;slotSize&quot;:[[300,250],&quot;fluid&quot;]},{&quot;browserLimit&quot;:[1260,0],&quot;slotSize&quot;:[[728,90],[300,250],[800,480],[600,480],&quot;fluid&quot;]}]\" data-tile-order=\"tile-8\" data-url=\"\/big-tech-private-data-facebook-google-apple-europe-eu-2021-1\" data-amazontamsizes=\"[[728,90],[300,250]]\" data-google-query-id=\"\">\n<div id=\"google_ads_iframe_\/4442842\/news\/opinion\/post_13__container__\"><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">&#8220;Every attempt to water down data protection in the name of supposed voluntary consent must be ruled out,&#8221; wrote Mathias D\u00f6pfner in <a style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/big-tech-private-data-facebook-google-apple-europe-eu-2021-1\">Business Insider<\/a> last month. &#8220;Permission to use data should not even be possible in the first place. Sensitive and personal data does not belong in the hands of platforms that rule the market (so-called gatekeepers) or in the hands of states.&#8221;<\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>Apple CEO Tim Cook also took to the virtual stage of a (usually) Brussels-based conference <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/28\/apples-tim-cook-warns-of-adtech-fuelling-a-social-catastrophe-as-he-defends-app-tracker-opt-in\/\">last month<\/a> to urge Europe to double down on enforcement of its flagship General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).<\/p>\n<p>In the speech, Cook warned that the adtech &#8220;data complex&#8221; is fuelling a social catastrophe by driving the spread of disinformation as it works to profit off of mass manipulation. He went on to urge lawmakers on both sides of the pond to &#8220;send a universal, humanistic response to those who claim a right to users\u2019 private information about what should not and will not be tolerated&#8221;. So it&#8217;s not just European companies (and institutions) calling for pro-privacy reform of adtech.<\/p>\n<p>The iPhone maker is preparing to introduce stricter limits on tracking on its smartphones by making apps ask users for permission to track, instead of just grabbing their data &#8212; a move that&#8217;s naturally raised the hackles of the adtech sector, which relies on mass surveillance to power &#8220;relevant&#8221; ads.<\/p>\n<p>Hence the adtech industry has resorted to crying &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/08\/googles-plan-to-replace-tracking-cookies-goes-under-uk-antitrust-probe\/\">antitrust<\/a>&#8221; as a tactic to push competition regulators to block platform-level moves against its consentless surveillance. And on that front it&#8217;s notable that the EDPS&#8217; <a href=\"https:\/\/edps.europa.eu\/sites\/edp\/files\/publication\/21-02-10-opinion_on_digital_markets_act_en.pdf\">opinion<\/a> on the DMA, which proposes extra rules for intermediating platforms with the most market power, reiterates the vital links between competition, consumer protection and data protection law &#8212; saying these three are &#8220;inextricably linked policy areas in the context of the online platform economy&#8221;; and that there &#8220;should be a relationship of complementarity, not a relationship where one area replaces or enters into friction with another&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Wiewior\u00f3wski also takes aim at recommender systems in his DSA opinion &#8212; saying these should not be based on profiling by default to ensure compliance with regional data protection rules (where privacy by design and default is supposed to be the legal default).<\/p>\n<p>Here too he calls for additional measures to beef up the Commission&#8217;s legislative proposal &#8212; with the aim of &#8220;further promot[ing] transparency and user control&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>This is necessary because such system have &#8220;significant impact&#8221;, the EDPS argues.<\/p>\n<p>The role of content recommendation engines in driving internet users toward hateful and extremist points of view has long been a subject of public scrutiny. Back in 2017, for example, U.K. parliamentarians grilled a number of tech companies on the topic &#8212; <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/12\/19\/youtube-more-ai-can-fix-ai-generated-bubbles-of-hate\/\">raising concerns<\/a> that AI-driven tools, engineered to maximize platform profit by increasing user engagement, risked automating radicalization, causing damage not just to the individuals who become hooked on hateful views the algorithms feeds them but cascading knock-on harms for all of us as societal cohesion is eaten away in the name of keeping the eyeballs busy.<\/p>\n<p>Yet years on, little information is available on how such algorithmic recommender systems work because the private companies that operate and profit off these AIs shield the workings as proprietary business secrets.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"OTwP293o8T\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/28\/apples-tim-cook-warns-of-adtech-fuelling-a-social-catastrophe-as-he-defends-app-tracker-opt-in\/\">Apple&#8217;s Tim Cook warns of adtech fuelling a &#8216;social catastrophe&#8217; as he defends app tracker opt-in<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Apple&#8217;s Tim Cook warns of adtech fuelling a &#8216;social catastrophe&#8217; as he defends app tracker opt-in&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/28\/apples-tim-cook-warns-of-adtech-fuelling-a-social-catastrophe-as-he-defends-app-tracker-opt-in\/embed\/#?secret=OTwP293o8T\" data-secret=\"OTwP293o8T\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>The Commission&#8217;s DSA proposal takes aim at this sort of secrecy as a bar to accountability &#8212; with its push for transparency obligations. The proposed obligations (in the initial draft) include requirements for platforms to provide \u201cmeaningful\u201d criteria used to target ads; and explain the \u201cmain parameters\u201d of their recommender algorithms; as well as requirements to foreground user controls (including at least one \u201cnonprofiling\u201d option).<\/p>\n<p>However, the EDPS wants regional lawmakers to go further in the service of protecting individuals from exploitation (and society as a whole from the toxic byproducts that flow from an industry based on harvesting personal data to manipulate people).<\/p>\n<p>On content moderation, Wiewior\u00f3wski&#8217;s opinion stresses that this should &#8220;take place in accordance with the rule of law&#8221;. Though the Commission draft has favored leaving it with platforms to interpret the law.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Given the already endemic monitoring of individuals\u2019 behaviour, particularly in the context of online platforms, the DSA should delineate when efforts to combat &#8216;illegal content&#8217; legitimise the use of automated means to detect, identify and address illegal content,&#8221; he writes, in what looks like a tacit recognition of <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/10\/03\/europes-top-court-sets-new-line-on-policing-illegal-speech-online\/\">recent CJEU jurisprudence<\/a> in this area.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Profiling for purposes of content moderation should be prohibited unless the provider can demonstrate that such measures are strictly necessary to address the systemic risks explicitly identified by the DSA,&#8221; he adds.<\/p>\n<p>The EDPS has also suggested minimum interoperability requirements for very large platforms, and for those designated as &#8220;gatekeepers&#8221; (under the DMA), and urges lawmakers to work to promote the development of technical standards to help with this at the European level.<\/p>\n<p>On the DMA, he also urges amendments to ensure the proposal &#8220;complements the GDPR effectively&#8221;, as he puts it, calling for &#8220;increasing protection for the fundamental rights and freedoms of the persons concerned, and avoiding frictions with current data protection rules&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Among the EDPS&#8217; specific recommendations are: That the DMA makes it clear that gatekeeper platforms must provide users with easier and more accessible consent management; clarification to the scope of data portability envisaged in the draft; and rewording of a provision that requires gatekeepers to provide other businesses with access to aggregated user data &#8212; again with an eye on ensuring &#8220;full consistency with the GDPR&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>The opinion also raises the issue of the need for &#8220;effective anonymisation&#8221; &#8212; with the EDPS calling for &#8220;re-identification tests when sharing query, click and view data in relation to free and paid search generated by end users on online search engines of the gatekeeper&#8221;.<\/p>\n<h2>ePrivacy reform emerges from stasis<\/h2>\n<p>Wiewior\u00f3wski&#8217;s contributions to shaping incoming platform regulations come on the same day that the European Council has finally reached agreement on its negotiating position for a long-delayed EU reform effort around existing <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/10\/07\/eprivacy-an-overview-of-europes-other-big-privacy-rule-change\/\">ePrivacy<\/a> rules.<\/p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.consilium.europa.eu\/en\/press\/press-releases\/2021\/02\/10\/confidentiality-of-electronic-communications-council-agrees-its-position-on-eprivacy-rules\/\">press release<\/a> announcing the development, the Commission writes that Member States agreed on a negotiating mandate for revised rules on the\u00a0protection of privacy and confidentiality in the use of electronic communications services.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;These updated \u2018ePrivacy\u2019 rules will define cases in which service providers are allowed to process electronic communications data or have access to data stored on end-users\u2019 devices,&#8221; it writes, adding: &#8220;Today\u2019s agreement allows the Portuguese presidency to start talks with the European Parliament on the final text.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Reform of the ePrivacy directive has been stalled for years as conflicting interests locked horns &#8212; putting paid to the (prior) Commission&#8217;s hopes that the whole effort could be done and dusted in 2018. (The <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/digital-single-market\/en\/proposal-eprivacy-regulation\">original ePrivacy reform proposal<\/a> came out in January 2017; four years later the Council has finally settled on its arguing mandate.)<\/p>\n<p>The fact that the GDPR was passed first appears to have upped the stakes for data-hungry ePrivacy lobbyists &#8212; in both the adtech and telco space (the latter having a keen interest in removing existing regulatory barriers on comms data in order that it can exploit the vast troves of user data which internet giants running rival messaging and VoIP services have long been able to).<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a concerted effort to try to use ePrivacy to undo consumer protections baked into GDPR &#8212; including attempts to water down protections provided for sensitive personal data. So the stage is set for an ugly rights battle as negotiations kick off with the European Parliament.<\/p>\n<p>Metadata and cookie consent rules are also bound up with ePrivacy, so there&#8217;s all sorts of messy and contested issues on the table here.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">An update of the ePrivacy rules are very much necessary to protect confidentiality of our communications: in 2002, it still took 5 years until the first iPhone, and there was hardly any instant messaging, video calls, and no inescapable commercial tracking practices<\/p>\n<p>&mdash; Sophie in &#39;t Veld (@SophieintVeld) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/SophieintVeld\/status\/1359489227608719363?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 10, 2021<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/div>\n<p>Digital rights advocacy group <a href=\"https:\/\/www.accessnow.org\/after-four-years-of-talks-eu-states-reach-underwhelming-agreement-on-eprivacy-reform\/\">Access Now<\/a> summed up the ePrivacy development by slamming the Council for &#8220;hugely&#8221; missing the mark.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe reform is supposed to strengthen privacy rights in the EU [but] States poked so many holes into the proposal that it now looks like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2010\/aug\/16\/swiss-win-the-gruyere-cheese-war\">French Gruy\u00e8re<\/a>,&#8221; said Estelle Mass\u00e9, senior policy analyst at Access Now, in a statement. \u201cThe text adopted today is below par when compared to the Parliament\u2019s text and previous versions of government positions.

Root&#8217;s IPO pricing run involved what we <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/20\/root-targets-6b-valuation-in-pending-ipo-a-boon-for-insurtech-startups\/\">thought of as a strong IPO range<\/a>\u00a0and then an above-target pricing.<\/p>\n<p>But since then, Lemonade shares have rallied to several times their original price, while Root has dropped around 20%. Lemonade, for reference, sells rental insurance with an eye on going up-market in time to other forms of home-focused insurance. Root is in the auto insurance market, where MetroMile also works.<\/p>\n<p>Both Lemonade and Root have yet to announce Q4 2020 results, so we&#8217;ll look at their Q3 details instead. We want to get a handle for how divergently their insurance incomes are being treated. This should give us a better understanding of how Wall Street values each, then we&#8217;ll apply what we learn to our two new companies. What we learn today will hopefully bear on other insurtech startups that want liquidity during the current cycle.<\/p>\n<p>Results via <a href=\"https:\/\/ir.joinroot.com\/static-files\/2bbfd172-5dd2-470a-a3c9-654bffc10e14\">the company<\/a>, comparisons are Q3 2019:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Root Q3 2020 revenue: $50.5 million (impaired from $75.8 million).<\/li>\n<li>Root Q3 2020 gross profit: $0.7 million (improved from -$36 million).<\/li>\n<li>Root Q3 2020 net loss: $85.2 million (improved from -$100.1 million).<\/li>\n<li>Premiums in force: $600.1 million.<\/li>\n<li>Valuation: $5.45 billion (Google Finance).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This gives us Root revenue run rate multiple of around 27x, and a premium in force multiple of just over 9x.
