<p>Every day, people around the world use data to make decisions.  When heading out of town, most of us use weather apps to check the forecast anywhere in the world before packing our bags.  However, when we travel to far-flung places, we may find ourselves packing food from home because we don’t know what may be available when we arrive.  We have a global, comprehensive, open data set that enables weather forecasting, but not something similar for food and agriculture?</p>
<p>In his first public remarks as head of USDA, Secretary Sonny Perdue noted that “…we want to make decisions based on facts and evidence,” “we want to be data-driven,” and “I need good data, I need good sound science to make decisions on…”</p>
<p>USDA recognizes that farmers, ranchers, and consumers alike &#8211; use data daily, from deciding when to plant, harvest or sell their crops, when to turn out cattle to pasture, or where to buy fresh fruits and vegetables.  This is why it is important that data be made available, open and accessible, to facilitate the best-informed decisions.</p>
<p>Around the world, a movement called the “open data revolution” is under way to make data available for public use.  This movement is expected to generate new insights, drive better decision-making, and enable governments, civil society, and the private sector to better target interventions and programs.</p>
<p>All of this is why the U.S. Government, led by USDA, was a founding partner of the Global Open Data for Agriculture and Nutrition (GODAN) initiative and why it continues to support the advancement of open data for agriculture and nutrition around the world.  Now with over 500 partners, GODAN continues to support the sharing of available, accessible, and usable open data for agriculture and nutrition to help ensure global food security.</p>
<p>If we’re going to feed over 9 billion people by 2050, we need open data policies to make decisions based on facts and evidence. This global perspective will help identify data already available and data gaps that exist, and sharpen the focus on how open data can foster innovation and collaborative research, creating whole new kinds of growth around the world.</p>

                <p>The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) has redesigned its International Energy Portal to streamline navigation, simplify data presentation, and implement responsive design use. EIA based many of the redesigned aspects on customer feedback about the earlier beta release of the portal.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eia.gov/international/overview/world" class="external ext-link" rel="external" onclick="this.target=&#039;_blank&#039;;">International Energy Portal</a> contains EIA’s country-level energy data. Users can view and download datasets for consumption, production, trade, reserves, and carbon dioxide emissions for different fuels and energy sources. The portal also provides access to EIA&#8217;s entire library of international reports, articles, and analyses, including <i>Country Analysis Briefs</i>.</p>
<p><b>Find data in fewer steps.</b></p>
<p>Users can select and explore prepopulated, fuel-specific default tables that provide annual data on energy production, consumption, trade, and reserves. Data options allow users to change time frequency and energy units, add sources and activities, and select other countries for comparison.</p>
<p><b>Customize data tables.</b></p>
<p>Customizable data tables allow users to sort by energy source and activity or by country and region. Users can now see and select countries within continental regions, International Energy Agency regions, and economic groups.</p>
<p><b>Tailor visualizations to user needs.</b></p>
<p>Animated maps allow users to see how trends in energy production, consumption, reserves, imports, and exports have changed over time. Other visualization options include heat maps, bubble maps, and time series.</p>
<p><b>Export data easily.</b></p>
<p>EIA’s international information is easily downloaded as data, maps, and charts for presentations, reports, and spreadsheets. Data downloads are available in CSV and JSON formats. Application Programming Interface (API) keys are available with EIA’s Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets add-ins, which make regular data updates much easier. Users can also download static versions of charts and tables in PDF or PNG image files.</p>

                <p style="font-weight: 400;">To a federal statistical agency like the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), there’s nothing more satisfying than providing needed information that can facilitate more informed analysis and policy decisions on a national and regional level. EIA recently launched its new&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.eia.gov/beta/electricity/gridmonitor/?src=email" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.eia.gov/beta/electricity/gridmonitor/?src%3Demail&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1574267669577000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF7QGBiA4TgNj1KToFU5C0xvK0nGA" class="external ext-link" rel="external" onclick="this.target=&#039;_blank&#039;;">Hourly Electric Grid Monitor</a></em>, a redesigned and enhanced version of EIA’s existing&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.eia.gov/realtime_grid/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.eia.gov/realtime_grid/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1574267669577000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHjA-Druh41rXereQkTEC7DTixlYw" class="external ext-link" rel="external" onclick="this.target=&#039;_blank&#039;;">U.S. Electric System Operating Data</a></em>&nbsp;website.&nbsp; The data for the&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.eia.gov/beta/electricity/gridmonitor/?src=email" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.eia.gov/beta/electricity/gridmonitor/?src%3Demail&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1574267669577000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF7QGBiA4TgNj1KToFU5C0xvK0nGA" class="external ext-link" rel="external" onclick="this.target=&#039;_blank&#039;;">Hourly Electric Grid Monitor</a></em>&nbsp;come from the Form EIA-930,&nbsp;<em>Hourly and Daily Balancing Authority Operations Report</em>, which collects hourly electricity demand, forecast demand, net generation, and interchange data from the 65 electricity balancing authorities that operate the electric grid in the Lower 48 states.&nbsp; The&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.eia.gov/beta/electricity/gridmonitor/?src=email" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.eia.gov/beta/electricity/gridmonitor/?src%3Demail&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1574267669577000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF7QGBiA4TgNj1KToFU5C0xvK0nGA" class="external ext-link" rel="external" onclick="this.target=&#039;_blank&#039;;">Hourly Electric Grid Monitor</a></em>&nbsp;incorporates two new data elements: hourly electricity generation by energy source and hourly subregional demand. The new website also provides new and more flexible options for visualizing the data and allows users to create custom dashboards that can be saved and shared.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Although electric system balancing authorities covering most of the United States have released real-time information on grid operations since the late 1990s, EIA’s Hourly Electric Grid Monitor expands the availability of data to the entire contiguous 48 states, and makes it available in a consistent format from a single source.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Among other applications, the data can be used to provide timely information on electric system recovery after power interruptions and to help evaluate the effects of renewable energy, smart grid, and demand-response programs on power system operations. &nbsp;The tool allows you to visualize and analyze:</p>
<ul style="font-weight: 400;">
<li>Total U.S. and regional electricity demand on an hourly basis</li>
<li>The varied mix of energy sources used to generate electricity at different times and locations</li>
<li>The hourly flow of electricity between electric systems</li>
<li>The wide variety in electric systems’ daily demand shapes and the seasonality of daily demand patterns</li>
<li>The extent to which electric systems rely on internal and external sources of supply to meet their demand</li>
<li>Potential stress on electric systems when actual demand significantly exceeds forecasted demand</li>
<li>Total hourly flows of electricity with Canada and Mexico</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Have fun exploring!</p>

                <p>As intermodal connectors for domestic and international freight, our nation’s ports serve a critical role in numerous supply chains and the national economy. In recognition of this importance, the <em>Fixing America&#8217;s Surface Transportation</em> (FAST) Act (P.L. 114-94; Dec. 4, 2015; 129 Stat. 1312) established a Port Performance Freight Statistics Program within the U.S. Department of Transportation: Bureau of Transportation Statistics. The first annual Port Performance Freight Statistics Program report provides descriptive statistics for a group of ports for year 2016, including the top 25 ports in terms of total tonnage, twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs), and dry bulk tonnage. The report is available to download at <a href="https://www.rita.dot.gov/bts/sites/rita.dot.gov.bts/files/PPFS_Annual_Report.pdf" class="external ext-link" rel="external" onclick="this.target=&#039;_blank&#039;;"><u>https://www.rita.dot.gov/bts/sites/rita.dot.gov.bts/files/PPFS_Annual_Report.pdf</u></a></p>
<p>The 2016 Port Performance report used multiple sources, including public datasets featured on Data.Gov. One foundational dataset used in the report is the total commercial tonnage carried on waterways published by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers – Waterborne Commerce Statistics Center.</p>

<p>Today, the&nbsp;<a id="anch_17" class="ext external ext-link" href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2020/12/07/hhs-publishes-covid-19-hospital-facility-level-data.html" rel="external" onclick="this.target=&#039;_blank&#039;;">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) published COVID-19 hospital data</a>&nbsp;at the facility level for each week, going back to August 1st 2020. This information was previously aggregated by state. This new data and its data quality are paramount to the U.S. pandemic response. COVID-19 models, analyses, and predictive analytics can only be as good as the data they ingest. By sharing these new hospital COVID-19 capacity data at the&nbsp;<a id="anch_18" href="https://healthdata.gov/dataset/covid-19-reported-patient-impact-and-hospital-capacity-facility" class="local-link">facility-level</a>&nbsp;with the public, the opportunity exists to improve data quality.</p>
<p>This data is tremendously complex and is the result of substantial ongoing efforts by hospital, state, and Federal personnel who collaborate to meet daily data reporting requirements. This ongoing collaboration has&nbsp;<a id="anch_19" href="https://healthdata.gov/covid-19-hospital-reporting-hospital-reporting-trend-dashboard" class="local-link">steadily improved data quality and reporting consistency</a>&nbsp;in recent weeks, even as the content of hospital capacity data has become more complex.</p>
<p>We opted not to have perfect be the enemy of good, so these datasets will have imperfections. To continue improving the quality of data, we welcome your feedback. When more people access and use the data, we have more collective ability to identify gaps, errors, or other problems with these COVID-19 datasets. All stakeholders — local community coordinators, data scientists, data journalists, and healthcare researchers — are encouraged to download, analyze, study the datasets, and&nbsp;<a id="anch_20" class="mailto" href="mailto:HealthData@hhs.gov?subject=COVID-19%20Open%20Data%20-%20feedback">share your feedback</a>&nbsp;with HealthData.gov.</p>
<p>We also encourage you to visit and contribute to&nbsp;<a id="anch_21" class="ext local-link" href="https://github.com/CareSet/COVID_Hospital_PUF">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</a>&nbsp;about this hospital-level data. These living FAQs are crowdsourced from the public, so your contributions will improve these FAQs over time.</p>
<p><strong>Commitment to Transparency and Open Data</strong></p>
<p>By opening COVID-19 datasets, our collective goal is to accelerate scientific and public health insights and shorten the time it takes for COVID-19 information and solutions to save lives. Our HHS efforts are enabling a data-driven ecosystem for everyone. Based on public feedback and interaction with the COVID-19 datasets, this open-data ecosystem will evolve while guided by these principles: Transparency. Sharing. Privacy. Security. Community.</p>
<p>Today’s unprecedented pandemic demands near-real-time data sharing across government, across diverse sectors, and with the public. HHS is aggressively responding to this call-to-action by responsibly unlocking information wherever our societal benefits of data access outweigh the potential risks. This is a collaborative effort led by HHS Office of the Chief Data Officer, within the Office of the Chief Information Officer, in close coordination with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), local/state/tribal governments, HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health (OASH), HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR), and the White House U.S. Digital Service.</p>
<p>Beyond the whole-of-government response, COVID-19 necessitates a whole-of-America response. Your public input so far has enabled HHS to identify and prioritize information of highest value. We appreciate the hard-working journalists, data scientists, academic healthcare researchers, business innovators, and Americans who are giving time, energy, and insights to help us responsibly open data related to the novel coronavirus.</p>
<p>The data reporting is one part of the whole-of-government response and is to ensure that every patient requiring hospitalization receives the care they need. Patients should not be discouraged from seeking hospital care based on their interpretation of the data. Hospitals have protocols in place to keep patients safe from exposure and to ensure all patients are prioritized for care. By working together across sectors, we are harnessing all capabilities and resources to unleash the power of U.S. data for the COVID-19 response.</p>
<p>Together, we can combat COVID-19.</p>

                <article class="no-image">
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today marks the launch of the </span><a href="https://catalog.data.gov/group/older-adults-health-data" class="local-link"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Older Adults Health Data Collection</span></em></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – a new resource cataloging over 200 Federal datasets previously available on Data.gov related to the health of older Americans. This centralized location will assist experts from academia, industry, government, civil society, and the public in accessing datasets from various Federal agencies and across a range of health-related issues (e.g. health status, health risks and behaviors, and health care) to advance our collective knowledge and understanding of the health of older adults.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analyzing data on the older adult population in the time periods before, during, and after the pandemic is an important step to gaining a better understanding of both the health of this age group as well the immediate and long-term impacts of the pandemic. The </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Older Adults Health Data Collection</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> contains datasets that capture outcomes directly related to COVID-19 as well as others that do not, and the number of COVID-19 related datasets in the collection is anticipated to grow over time. Datasets without COVID-19-specific data elements still provide important context on the health of older adults before the pandemic and are likely to incorporate COVID-19 data elements in their data collection procedures in the months and years to come.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Demographic trends underscore just how vital it will be to understand this growing population group. By 2030, one in five Americans will be 65 years and older. Over the next 40 years, the number of Americans 65 years and older will almost double.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><sup>1</sup></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> COVID-19 has also significantly impacted this age group, as underscored by evidence that older adults have experienced the highest hospitalization and morbidity rates from the pandemic.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><sup>2</sup></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This is partly the result of older adults having high rates of chronic diseases, such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes, arthritis, and cancer, which are the Nation’s leading drivers of illness, disability, deaths, and health care costs.&nbsp;</span></p>
