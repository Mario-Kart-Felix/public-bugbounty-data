Also, the browser plugin often gets broken with new versions of Chrome, and Firefox. It is not the most ‚Äúseemless‚Äù experience, so I looked for a better option. Super dev mode works nice in Chrome, which is what I use for GWT development.</p> <p>GWT has now added support for source maps ( more info on source maps <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/developertools/sourcemaps/">here</a>). In my eyes it is the future of all <a href="https://github.com/jashkenas/coffee-script/wiki/List-of-languages-that-compile-to-JS">Languages that compile to Javascript</a>. When supported, it will allow GWT to be debugged in any browser. I believe Firefox and Chrome currently support it. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised...<span>

  <span><p>After I installed the Windows 8.1 update, and I kind of destroyed my machine and had to re-install Windows fresh. This was pretty easy, but I lost all the configuration I had setup for developing with <a href="http://github.com">Github</a> and <a href="http://bitbucket.org">Bitbucket</a>.</p> <p>So, here is the quickest way I found to get setup and ready to contribute on <a href="http://github.com">Github</a> and <a href="http://bitbucket.org">Bitbucket</a>.</p> <h2 id="installation-of-tools">Installation of Tools</h2> <h3 id="ssh">SSH</h3> <p>To solve my ssh requirement, which I use for both git and mercurial, I simply installed <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">Putty</a>, which I belive is pretty standard for ssh on windows. I opted to go with the <a href="http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/x86/putty-0.62-installer.exe">Putty Installer</a>. It should install a few different tools that will be necessary in the future.</p> <h5 id="chocolatey-alternative">Chocolatey Alternative</h5> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-powershell" data-lang="powershell">cinst putty</code></pre></figure> <h3 id="git">Git</h3> <p><a href="">Git for Windows</a> has an <a href="http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/downloads/detail?name=Git-1.8.3-preview20130601.exe&amp;can=2&amp;q=full+installer+official+git">installer</a> which makes the git installation pretty simple.

  <span><h2 id="how-i-got-the-gig">How I got the gig</h2> <p>As a younger developer, I had never really pursuited speaking about technical topics. I recently graduated from University of Michigan : Dearborn, so full-time work and school doesn‚Äôt leave a ton of free time. This opportunity kind of fell in my lap. Randomly, my boss received an email from the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Detroit-Google-Developers-Group/">Detroit Google Developers Group</a>. They were looking for speakers on non-Android related topics (the group has primarily been dominated by Android related topics). Someone had referred them to iRule because we use GWT (<a href="http://gwtproject.org">Google Web Toolkit</a>) pretty heavily throughout our solution. At the end there is a link to the speakerdeck slides.</p> <h2 id="first-time-speaking">First Time Speaking</h2> <p>I have never thought of public speaking as one of my stronger points, so I was pretty nervous about talking in front of a crowd.

  <span><h3 id="new-android-build-system">New Android Build System</h3> <p>If you haven‚Äôt seen / heard of the new android build system ( still work in progress ), then you should definitely go read up on it. There is some great material on the <a href="http://tools.android.com/tech-docs/new-build-system">Android Tools Project Site</a>.</p> <h3 id="building-android-projects-with-ant">Building Android projects with Ant</h3> <p><a href="http://ant.apache.com">Ant</a> has it‚Äôs strengths, but the lack of IDE integration (can‚Äôt run task and attach debugger and a pain to use with Eclipse) is really what has made me an early adopter of the new <a href="http://gradle.org">Gradle</a> based build system. I currently have an ant script that is powered by the default build that is packaged with the androd sdk. I hijacked a few tasks to add the <code class="highlighter-rouge">versionName</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">sourceVersion</code> (build ID) to the output file. Also, in the midst of the madness, I get the current revision number from <a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/">Mercurial</a> and use that as my build ID. It has become very useful for traceability...<span>

  <span><h3 id="engine--site-generator">Engine / Site Generator</h3> <p>I work on Mac OS X at work, but often times find myself learning new technologies or ‚Äúmessing around‚Äù on a Windows 8.X machine. So, I looked at a C# blog engine. Didn‚Äôt really find anything that was really simple to host and easy to modify (I am lazy, anything that required significant work, I gave up on).</p> <p>After reading a few other posts about setting up blogs, I read about static-site generators. Did a little research, and <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> seems to be the most popular, probably because of its origins and support on <a href="http://github.com">Github</a>. This made my choice a lot simpler.
