And it had nothing to do with promoting another goofball buddy flick. It was a Super Bowl commercial launched by General Motors as the largest U.S. automaker marked its newfound ambitions as an electric-carmaker. Less than two weeks ago, GM caught some people by surprise with its pledge to make the vast majority of the vehicles it produces electric by 2035. Amid growing calls for action on climate change, some argue it has the potential to be transformative. And for the North American energy sector, particularly oil and gasoline producers, understanding the implications of the electric vehicle (EV) push just became that much more urgent. Long-term implications Warren Mabee, director of Queen&#x27;s University&#x27;s Institute for Energy and Environmental Policy, believes for the oilpatch, the significance of GM&#x27;s announcement outweighs the recent cancellation of Keystone XL. &quot;That really starts to eat away at the demand side of the equation as consumers have more and more electric vehicles available to them,&quot; Mabee said. &quot;And as the costs sort of come in line with what [consumers are] expecting to pay, I think we&#x27;re going to see fewer and fewer people opting for gasoline-powered vehicles. &quot;That really has long-term implications for the industry.&quot; But he sees opportunities, too, whether they are in batteries or hydrogen. &quot;Let&#x27;s try to beat some others to the punch because I think there&#x27;s some real potential.&quot; Some market observers have called GM&#x27;s target date &quot;aggressive.&quot; The complexity of the task is substantial and the pledge, as critics have pointed out, is aspirational. Significant EV growth will also require a backbone of infrastructure such as recharging stations. Supply chains will need to be established to support key components such as batteries and power systems. Also key to the effort, if the goal is to slash carbon emissions, is ensuring there is the necessary infrastructure capable of providing renewable energy for plug-in vehicles. Jody Freeman, a counselor for energy and climate change in the Obama White House in 2009 and 2010, wrote earlier this month in the New York Times: &quot;Shifting from gasoline to electricity helps to decarbonize transportation only if the electrons fuelling cars and trucks are relatively &#x27;green.&#x27;&quot; An industry-wide sea change General Motors&#x27; plans will see it invest $27 billion US in electric and autonomous vehicles in the next five years. &quot;There can be no doubt the future of transportation, starting now, is electric,&quot; said Fred Krupp, head of the Environmental Defence Fund, which is working with GM on the strategy. And GM is not alone. Last week, Ford Motor Co. said it would spend at least $22 billion US developing EVs from 2016 through 2025, nearly double what it previously announced. Among others, Volkswagen is spending billions of dollars in its pursuit of all-electric Tesla. And, last fall, California&#x27;s Governor Gavin Newson inked an executive order stating all new passenger cars and trucks sold in the state would have to be emission-free by 2035. Will drivers come for the ride? Of course, GM promising to go electric doesn&#x27;t guarantee success. There&#x27;s a lot of work ahead. But Mabee believes GM can reach its goal, suggesting big manufacturers have the kind of heft needed to make technological improvements in key areas such as battery life and efficiency. Consumers will have to come along for the ride, too. While GM sold more than 2.5 million vehicles in the U.S. last year, only about 20,000 were electric vehicles, according to Reuters. Analysts at Rystad Energy said that as battery costs decline, vehicle performance increases and charging infrastructure improves, electric mobility will eventually out-compete its internal combustion engine counterparts. To that end, EV technology is advancing rapidly. However, Brian Kingston, president of the Canadian Vehicle Manufacturers&#x27; Association, said this week in the National Observer, &quot;price parity with gas-powered vehicles remains years off.&quot; Others believe that day could come in the next couple of years. That&#x27;s why some proponents argue rebates and government incentives are so important to grow the market. The entry-level price of a new Chevrolet Bolt EV hatchback, for example, is more than $45,000 in Canada. Still, a recent report from Deloitte found U.S. consumers&#x27; biggest concern regarding all-electric vehicles was range and a lack of charging infrastructure, not the price of the vehicle. And, in Canada, some argue one of the challenges facing would-be buyers is the ability to find one at the dealership. Still lots of road ahead For proponents of EVs, automakers&#x27; big investments in the sector provide reason for optimism, but there&#x27;s still a lot of ground to make up. Dennis DesRosiers, an analyst with DesRosiers Automotive Consultants, noted North America has had electrified vehicles for years now, but they still only make up a small percentage of the overall market. Last summer, the Paris-based International Energy Agency estimated that electric car sales will account for about three per cent of global car sales in 2020. In the first and second quarters of 2020, 3.5 per cent of total new vehicles registered in Canada were zero-emission vehicles, according to Statistics Canada, a category that includes battery-electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids. &quot;At some point in this century — not this decade, this century — all vehicle companies will have 100 per cent electric vehicles for sale,&quot; said DesRosiers, who is based in Richmond Hill, about 35 km north of Toronto. &quot;That being said, the GM announcement is aggressive in terms of time frame.&quot; The long life of gas-powered cars Transformation to electric vehicles would mean a slowing demand for gasoline, DesRosiers said, but not overnight. New cars entering the market today will have a long road life and the vast majority of those vehicles run on gasoline or diesel, he said. Improved fuel efficiency means new gasoline-powered vehicles will require less fuel than in the past, DeRosiers said, but &quot;the oilpatch has got quite a long road in front of it still.&quot; &quot;At some point, energy demand related to carbon-based fuels is going to collapse.&quot; &quot;But I think it&#x27;s probably a good 20 to 30 years out, possibly even more.&quot; Richard Masson, an executive fellow at the University of Calgary&#x27;s School of Public Policy, said the oilpatch has to pay attention but doesn&#x27;t expect a precipitous drop in demand for Alberta crude. Looking out over the next two decades, Masson said oil markets will need more crude to replace anticipated production declines elsewhere. &quot;Alberta is very secure, stable, connected to a big market,&quot; said Masson, former head of the Alberta Petroleum Marketing Commission. &quot;We can easily be a good part of that energy mix going forward.&quot; Energy transition &#x27;on its way&#x27; But if fuel and oil demand is squeezed, the big challenge for Canadian oilsands producers may be to be cost-competitive in a global market while also facing environmental scrutiny from investors. &quot;If I&#x27;m looking at the global demand picture, it means that the competition became that much tighter,&quot; said Al Salazar, vice-president of intelligence at Enverus, an energy data analytics firm.</p></div></div></div></li><li class="js-stream-content Pos(r)" data-reactid="67"><div class="Py(14px) Pos(r)" data-test-locator="mega" data-reactid="68"><div class="Cf" data-reactid="69"><div class="Ov(h) Pend(14%) Pend(44px)--sm1024" data-reactid="70"><div class="Fz(12px) Fw(b) Tt(c) D(ib) Mb(6px) C($c-fuji-blue-3-a) Mend(9px) Mt(-2px)" data-test-locator="catlabel" data-reactid="71">Science</div><div class="C(#959595) Fz(11px) D(ib) Mb(6px)" data-reactid="72">The Canadian Press</div><h3 class="Mb(5px)" data-reactid="73"><a class="js-content-viewer wafer-caas Fw(b) Fz(20px) Lh(23px) Fz(17px)--sm1024 Lh(19px)--sm1024 mega-item-header-link Td(n) C(#0078ff):h C(#000) LineClamp(2,46px) LineClamp(2,38px)--sm1024 not-isInStreamVideoEnabled" href="/latest-numbers-covid-19-canada-090000472.html" data-uuid="bccc9fdc-64d3-3746-a733-05790edcaa23" data-wf-caas-uuid="bccc9fdc-64d3-3746-a733-05790edcaa23" data-wf-caas-prefetch="1" data-reactid="74"><u class="StretchedBox" data-reactid="75"></u><!-- react-text: 76 -->The latest numbers on COVID-19 in Canada for Wednesday, Feb. 10, 2021<!-- /react-text --></a></h3><p class="Fz(14px) Lh(19px) Fz(13px)--sm1024 Lh(17px)--sm1024 LineClamp(3,57px) LineClamp(3,51px)--sm1024 M(0)" data-reactid="77">The latest numbers of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Canada as of 4 a.m. ET on Wednesday, Feb. 10, 2021.

Flair, which bills itself as Canada&#x27;s only independent low-fare airline, announced flights will begin May 1 in Halifax and Saint John, and in Charlottetown on June 4. The airline will add the following Maritime routes: Service to Toronto, Ottawa and Waterloo out of Halifax. Service to Toronto from Charlottetown and Saint John. Flair had originally intended to expand into the Maritimes in 2020, but put those plans on hold because of the pandemic.The Maritime flights are part of a broader expansion that includes eight new Canadian destinations. According to the Flair website, a return flight from Charlottetown to Toronto, including taxes and fees, will cost $98.27. Flair president and CEO Stephen Jones said Flair continues to support the restrictions on non-essential travel, but he believes travel restrictions will have eased enough by this summer for the airline to get a full domestic network flying. Jones acknowledged there is still uncertainty. &quot;No one&#x27;s got a crystal ball, but we just have to make our plans based on the best evidence that we have,&quot; he said. &quot;If we don&#x27;t decide now and we don&#x27;t move now it&#x27;ll be too late for the summer, because we need to allow some time for people to book flights. So we&#x27;re planning now, we&#x27;re going on sale now, and we&#x27;re hoping that people will start to plan their summers now with a degree of confidence and positivity as well.&quot; The airline is providing COVID coverage that will allow people to get refunds or change flights. With the new destinations, Flair will serve 18 cities in Canada.

Phase two of the plan is slated to begin in April. It will focus on the general population in 10-year increments, starting with people in their 60s. The second phase is also set to include vaccinations for those in emergency shelters and those living and working in group homes for people with intellectual disabilities. &quot;And as I understand, the objective is to get as many people immunized as quickly as possible,&quot; said Dr. Dennis Kendel, a retired physician and health policy consultant. &quot;I think the decision to actually proceed in progressive age cohorts probably is the best decision, because when you&#x27;re trying to mobilize something as massive as this, trying to focus on special interest groups and special needs populations has much potential to actually slow things down.&quot; The province says that once Phase 2 is underway, vaccinations will be available through mass immunization clinics, walk-in and drive-thru clinics, public health clinics and community-based options such as pharmacies. Kendel says this diversity of immunization venues has the potential to work well. &quot;At the peak of the distribution process, there would be 2,200 people involved in the vaccination process. So that would be people booking the appointments and facilitating moving through clinics and those actually giving the shots,&quot; Kendel said. According to the province, some of this staff would be drawn from the existing Saskatchewan Health Authority workforce, including non-clinical staff. The SHA intends to reach out to medical students and retired health professionals as well. &quot;I do think that a lot of people are quite willing to step forward and help out, even though they may have been retired for a short while. They haven&#x27;t lost their skills and hopefully they can be part of the the group that gets this done,&quot; Kendel said. &quot;This is all predicated on an assumption of reasonably predictable supply and there have been problems which have been universal across Canada. So we aren&#x27;t unique in that regard.&quot; The province says the commencement of mass vaccinations will depend on the number and consistency of vaccine deliveries from the federal government. Supply has been recently delayed. But the provincial government says it is hopeful that mass vaccinations can start as soon as April, based on the current federal vaccine delivery schedule. &quot;Some of the problems that caused delay earlier are now resolved. The Pfizer plant shutdown is coming to an end, so Pfizer will actually be producing more than they did previously,&quot; Kendel said. &quot;If something does interrupt supply, then we have to make adjustments and accommodate that. Getting angry at another level of government or getting angry at the supplier doesn&#x27;t help. We have to deal with it as it comes.&quot; Vaccine rollout so far Dr. Cory Neudorf, public health physician and community health and epidemiology professor at the University of Saskatchewan, calls the distribution plan &quot;clear and transparent.&quot; &quot;I think the age-based approach ... really fits with their goal of wanting to protect the most vulnerable and those at highest risk and sort of preventing that serious illness and death that&#x27;s going to end up causing the most serious impact on people of Saskatchewan and also on the health-care system,&quot; Neudorf said. He says that Saskatchewan&#x27;s vaccine rollout has been good so far. &quot;I think the ability to try to maximize the number of doses, including recognizing that there was a little more vaccine in each vial than the five doses required has allowed us to actually get more doses out than we were told were shipped to us,&quot; Neudorf said. &quot;The speed at which they rolled that out in the first few weeks of January ... we really caught up. And it was it was quite impressive.&quot; But Neudorf said he would like to hear from the province about the vaccination plan for those individuals that are living with front-line workers or those that work with the vulnerable populations addressed in Phase 2 of the plan.

Regina is experiencing a burgeoning wave of experimental and urban musicians, and a rise in visual storytellers, with a plethora of young Black talent leading the way. Many of these creators are forging a new path in their field without much of a blueprint to follow, as few Black people have occupied these spaces in Saskatchewan&#x27;s capital city before. Take 27-year-old Janielle Ogilvie, a Black female graphic designer who isn&#x27;t sure if she&#x27;s ever &quot;seen anybody else like me&quot; in her field here. Ogilvie has made her identity as a Black creative an integral element of her work. &quot;Personally, I would like to identify as a Black creator,&quot; Ogilvie said. &quot;A lot of people reach out to me because they want to see a diverse vision. They want to work with someone who has experienced certain things, and that&#x27;s where I come in with my experience as a Black person.&quot; Not only is this reflected in the type of art Ogilvie creates, but also in the purpose for which she creates it. &quot;I&#x27;m doing a lot of things for the Black community. I get a lot of people reaching out to me in regards to making something for causes like Black Lives Matter,&quot; she said. Ogilvie also joined the board of directors at CJTR, the local community radio station, in September 2019. This brought a number of job opportunities her way. &quot;I&#x27;ve been able to collaborate with a lot of other artists that way, meet new people, and managed to get a full-time job doing graphic designing as well,&quot; she said. With her passions for music, art and her community, Ogilvie hopes to do more work focused in these areas moving forward. &#x27;I am Black first before I am an artist&#x27; Like Ogilvie, 23-year-old hip-hop artist Oboise identifies as a Black creator. &quot;I am Black first before I am an artist. My experiences inspire what I put into my music,&quot; he said. His song &quot;Listen Up&quot; arguably reveals the most about the musician&#x27;s life as a Black man. &quot;I wrote that song to touch on life in general and after many instances of seeing what people from the Black community are forced to deal with,&quot; Oboise said. &quot;After having racial slurs thrown at me and seeing people being killed for their skin colour, I couldn&#x27;t sit by and not speak on it.&quot; Oboise moved to Regina from Calgary five years ago, and it&#x27;s then that he started making music. At the time, he didn&#x27;t know many people in the biz and set about making his own mark. &quot;I believe I&#x27;m one of the few artists who is incredibly versatile and I do it well,&quot; Oboise said. &quot;When I create, it stems from weeks or months of studying certain genres and artists. I don&#x27;t seek to make music that is trending or to pose as someone I&#x27;m not.&quot; The rapper has been consistent and relentless in his pursuit of a music career. He has released six major singles, five EPs, and two full-length albums in the span of four years. Oboise also quickly became the go-to rapper for collaborations in Regina. Last year alone, he was featured on three major records from the city&#x27;s contemporary music scene: Up and Away by Rooky, Slippin&#x27; by TOVA, and Online by D4WN. Oboise has tackled a variety of genres over the years. His most recent E.P., &quot;Feels Like A Sunday,&quot; finds the rapper tackling gospel rap and sharing a vulnerable side of his artistry. He said he consciously worked with another Black artist on the track because he knew he &quot;needed someone with a soulful voice and seeing as soul music originated in the African American community, I knew I needed a strong powerful Black voice.&quot; But Oboise said he does not exclusively collaborate with Black musicians. &quot;I work with artists based on their skill and what they bring to the table.&quot; With over 150,000 streams and 31,000 views on YouTube, Oboise still believes that his greatest accomplishment as a musician is being able to create art that people can relate to. &quot;When people tell you that your music has inspired them to start their own music and create a better relationship with their parents — that means a lot more than exposure can mean.&quot; For more stories about the experiences of Black Canadians — from anti-Black racism to success stories within the Black community — check out Being Black in Canada, a CBC project Black Canadians can be proud of.

After this newspaper and other media outlets had reported on the unsuccessful FOIPOP (Freedom of Information) request made by the Nova Scotia Progressive Conservative Education Critic Tim Halman asking for air quality reports from the province’s schools, the quiet release of these documents was perplexing. The Journal contacted Halman for his reaction to the reports and made inquiries regarding the report to the Department of Education and Early Childhood Development and the Strait Regional Centre for Education (SRCE). Halman told The Journal last week (Feb. 5), “In the last few days there have been many government announcements ... we know the government doesn’t have a problem giving notices and announcements. The last couple of days has clearly demonstrated that. Why didn’t they do an announcement on this? Why is this information posted and no advertisement or notice given to the public? “I have four kids. I send my kids to school. I don’t believe there is a safety issue, but I believe there is a lack of accountably and transparency issue,” said Halman, who was a teacher for 15 years before entering politics. In addition to the quiet rollout, the summary reports offer very little information about the state of ventilation in schools and no information detailing the expenditure of the $2.7 million earmarked for ventilation maintenance and cleaning from the Federal Funding Safe Return to Class monies. The summary reports consist of a chart listing each school in the regional centre for education and a brief response to each of the following categories: System Type (Active or Passive), Inspection completed by Sept 8, 2020 (Yes or No), Maintenance Complete? (Yes / No / N/A), System Operating as Intended? (Yes or No). Halman said of the report, “The information that’s been provided, it’s very surface level; there’s nothing in depth. You look at the quality of the data that’s been provided – you can raise a lot of questions about that.” Halman likens the difficulty in gaining access to information on ventilation to that of the process in gaining access to reports on lead in school water supplies, information released in Sept. 2020; and air quality problems at Ian Forsyth Elementary School in Dartmouth, in Halman’s riding, which resulted in parents pulling students out of the school in March of 2018. The Journal asked the Department of Education and Early Childhood Development via email why there was no publicity surrounding the release of the summary reports, how and where the full reports could be accessed, and for an accounting of the federal monies spent on ventilation. The response to these questions, via email from Violet MacLeod, a communications advisor for the Department of Education and Early Childhood Development, did not answer any of these questions. The response stated, “Public Health has confirmed that there is no current test to directly check for COVID in the air … Public Health directed us to focus on ventilation. Ventilation system checks have been done at each and every school before students returned in the fall. Systems were checked, repaired as needed and confirmed to be in good working order; windows are able to open and systems are working as designed. The results of these checks are on the Regions/CSAP’s websites. “Additionally, we’ve invested $2.7 million in funding to ensure checks happen through the school year and that needed repairs are made quickly with 24/hour on-call maintenance services. This is over and above annual maintenance,” wrote MacLeod. The Journal also asked the SRCE why it did not publicize the release of the ventilation reporting summary. In an email response Tuesday (Feb. 9), SRCE’s Coordinator of Communications Deanna Gillis stated, “The SRCE uses a number of communications platforms, including print, online and social media, to regularly share information with students, staff and families on a variety of education matters. They include the SRCE website (srce.ca), Twitter (@SRCE_NS), the monthly report of the Regional Executive Director, the Stay Informed notification system for class/bus announcements and news items, region-wide email alerts, and the srce@srce.ca general email is also widely shared for inquiries.” Information about the availability of the SRCE’s ventilation reporting summary was not in the most recent regional executive director’s report. It was not posted on SRCE twitter nor emailed to parents and guardians. It is available on the SRCE website: https://srce.ca/.

This year, the planning, preparation and delivery has been altered by the pandemic, but COVID-19 has also made the need greater, as women and children are more likely to find themselves confined with abusive men. According to a national survey, gender-based violence during the height of the COVID-19 lockdown in Canada was more severe and more frequent. Manpreet Multani of the World Sikh Organization of Canada, one of the groups behind the initiative, said 1,100 care packages will go to women at 25 shelters in B.C. this year. She estimates that other groups across the country will bring the national total close to 3,000 packages. The initiative is called One Billion Rising — a name drawn from the statistic that one-third of the world&#x27;s 3.5 billion women will experience physical or sexual assault in their lifetime, according to Multani. Typically the contents of the care packages would be collected through a donation drive and fundraising. This year, however, it was limited to a fundraising campaign and the items were then purchased. Previously, the packages are all assembled in a central location, but as a result of the pandemic, about 90 families picked up the supplies to put the care packages together at home. It differs from province to province, said Multani, but in B.C., the brown gift bags are filled with essential hygiene items, including toothpaste, toothbrushes, soap, shampoo and conditioner — all items suggested by the shelters. &#x27;There are people out there rooting for them&#x27; The bags are adorned with kind notes, and school children make personal cards to put inside. &quot;The recipients can know that there are people out there rooting for them and wishing them the best in life,&quot; said Multani. The delivery of the care packages has also been modified to ensure they&#x27;re COVID-safe. The volunteers won&#x27;t have a face-to-face experience with the recipients, and delivery is being made a few days early so the packages can remain isolated before they&#x27;re distributed to the women staying in shelters. This will be Multani&#x27;s first year taking part in the effort. She said she wanted to get involved to help break the stigma and help women and children in tough situations. &quot;I&#x27;m a big advocate for women&#x27;s rights, and in the Punjabi community, sometimes domestic violence can be a big issue and it&#x27;s kept very hush-hush,&quot; she said. Other groups helping to organize the care packages include Centre For Israel and Jewish Affairs, Guru Nanak&#x27;s Free Kitchen, Living Interfaith Sanctuary, Local Congregations of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and Worldwide Shift Disturbers.

In a collaborative effort between Temagami First Nation, Ontario Power Generation (OPG), Sault Ste. Marie Museum, and Woodland Heritage Northeast, the historical pictograph was repatriated to Bear Island just before Christmas 2020. Temagami First Nation’s director of lands and resources Robin Koistinen said she has known about the missing pictograph for 25 years and has tried to locate it numerous times. “We are very proud to have it back. Back on our land,” Koistinen said. “It really was a team effort.” It is a 300-pound, metre-wide rock slab depicting three figures. The slab had fallen off the main rock face and was found lying face down at Matabichuan River by archaeologist Thor Conway in the &#x27;70s. At the time, there were concerns that flooding and fluctuating water levels, caused by development on the river, could damage the rock and the paint. According to Conway’s notes, the slab was taken to the regional archaeologist’s office in Sault Ste. Marie in 1977 for temporary study. The plans were then to return the slab to Temagami for public display. “It is a preferred heritage policy only to remove rock art from its original setting under exceptional circumstances since paintings are so vitally tied by traditional beliefs to their local environment,” Conway wrote in 1980. However, the rock went missing and its location was unknown until last year. In the summer of 2020, OPG’s senior environment advisor Gillian MacLeod called Koistinen asking Temagami to participate in some archaeological assessment work at the Matabichuan River. Koistinen agreed to send two field technicians Victoria Winsor and elder Mike Paul to the site, but there was a catch. &quot;When Gillian wanted to the work this summer, I said as part of the work and us assisting them, I wanted the pictograph located and returned to us,&quot; she said. Working on the summer project were also Ryan Primrose, an archaeologist from the Woodland Heritage Northeast, and OPG’s Indigenous Relations Officer Sue Prince. “Nobody knew where it was. And then, all of the sudden, somebody had a cue to call Sault Ste. Marie and, sure enough, there our pictograph was,” Koistinen said. “We’re very pleased to have it back within our nation.” Just before Christmas, Winsor and a Temagami community member Mike Polson travelled to Sault Ste. Marie Museum to pick up the artifact. On the way back, their vehicle had to be barged across the lake to Bear Island to avoid damaging the artifact. The pictograph is now displayed at the newly-built 16,000 square-foot Lakeview Gathering Place on Bear Island, where community members will be able to see the slab once the pandemic restrictions are lifted. OPG helped with the efforts, including retrieving and protecting the pictograph while it was moved around, making sure that the display cabinet was suitable for its weight, and installing a plaque and descriptive display materials, according to Winsor. “The process of finding this artifact was a fantastic collaborative effort,” Winsor said in a statement. “The museum’s curator has been enthusiastically assisting us, and the museum’s board have voted unanimously to repatriate the artifact … It is my hope that the return of an artifact represents a change in how archaeology and repatriation is conducted.” This is the first repatriated artifact that is going to stay in the community. Previously, different artifacts were lent by museums to Temagami for educational purposes. “But knowing how unique and special they are, we returned them because some of those facilities can take better care of some of those items because we don’t have the proper means to keep them in good condition,” Koistinen said. “But it is our desire to repatriate our goods, our history, our implements, our artifacts.” The pictograph isn’t something that can deteriorate like other artifacts, Koistinen said, and being in a display case in an air-controlled environment, as opposed to being exposed to natural elements, it should be “fine where it is,&quot; she said. “We want to provide more context around it and label it more properly, so the history is with it there too, so people can understand it,” she said. “There’s a little more work to do to really, really make it display-worthy.” Dariya Baiguzhiyeva, Local Journalism Initiative Reporter, TimminsToday.com</p></div></div></div></li><li class="js-stream-content Pos(r)" data-reactid="169"><div class="Py(14px) Pos(r)" data-test-locator="mega" data-reactid="170"><div class="Cf" data-reactid="171"><div class="Fl(start) Pos(r) Mt(2px) W(26.5%) Maw(220px)" data-reactid="172"><div class="H(0) Ov(h) Bdrs(2px)" style="padding-bottom:56%;" data-reactid="173"><img srcset="https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/VJGBZWVc.OrfclhA8SmK3g--~B/Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0xMjM7cT04MDt3PTIyMDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/m6mYXoM.swAs24h5nMdf2A--~B/aD0zNDk7dz02MjA7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cbc.ca/d7bc08d4537072ee377e8fb49d6e7102.cf.jpg 1x,https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/U61Yy.P5al4zi.XRxRVjCw--~B/Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0yNDY7cT04MDt3PTQ0MDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/m6mYXoM.swAs24h5nMdf2A--~B/aD0zNDk7dz02MjA7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cbc.ca/d7bc08d4537072ee377e8fb49d6e7102.cf.jpg 2x" class=" W(100%) Trsdu(0s)!

Ottawa Public Health (OPH) is reporting 26 new cases of COVID-19 and one more death Wednesday. There are only 19 residents in hospital for COVID-19 treatment, the lowest that number has been in more than a month. Quebec school administrators say report cards show many students are struggling, leading to calls for the Quebec government to lower the bar for CEGEP admissions. An Ottawa retirement home manager has been suspended after accusations he allowed his wife to receive a dose of the COVID-19 vaccine intended for a front-line worker. How many cases are there? As of Wednesday, 13,759 Ottawa residents have tested positive for COVID-19. There are 402 known active cases, 12,929 resolved cases and 428 deaths from COVID-19. Public health officials have reported more than 24,500 COVID-19 cases across eastern Ontario and western Quebec, including more than 23,100 resolved cases. Elsewhere in eastern Ontario, 125 people have died of COVID-19, and 156 people have died in western Quebec. CBC Ottawa is profiling those who&#x27;ve died of COVID-19. If you&#x27;d like to share your loved one&#x27;s story, please get in touch. What can I do? The Ontario stay-at-home order remains for the three local areas that have not moved back to the five-colour scale: the Eastern Ontario Health Unit, Leeds, Grenville and Lanark District Health Unit and Ottawa Public Health. People there must only leave home when it&#x27;s essential. People who leave home for non-essential reasons can be fined. WATCH | Lowertown residents concerned over lack of notice about isolation centre: Travel between regions and provinces is not recommended. Private indoor gatherings are not allowed, while outdoor gatherings are capped at five people. It&#x27;s strongly recommended people stick to their own households and socializing is not considered essential. People who live alone are allowed close contact with one other household. Most outdoor recreation venues remain open with restrictions, including the full Rideau Canal Skateway. Students across eastern Ontario can return to the classroom. The rules change as regions move back to the scale. WATCH | Ontario&#x27;s new ski hill rules: Hastings Prince Edward Public Health, Kingston, Frontenac and Lennox &amp; Addington Public Health and the Renfrew County and District Health Unit are moving back into green today, the lowest level on the scale. It&#x27;s expected the rest of eastern Ontario will shed the stay-at-home order Tuesday. Their colours have not been announced. Western Quebec residents are also being asked to stay home unless it&#x27;s essential to leave and not see anyone they don&#x27;t live with. An exception for people living alone allows them to exclusively visit one other home. Non-essential businesses, hair salons and museums are now allowed to open across Quebec. Locally, gyms and restaurants will stay closed. Students are back in classrooms, including post-secondary ones. Like in Ontario, travel from one region of Quebec to another is discouraged. Quebec&#x27;s 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew remains in place, and people could face fines of up to $6,000 for breaking the rules. It no longer applies to people experiencing homelessness. Distancing and isolating The novel coronavirus primarily spreads through droplets when an infected person speaks, coughs, sneezes, or breathes onto someone or something. These droplets can hang in the air. People can be contagious without symptoms, even after getting a vaccine. New coronavirus variants can be more contagious. This means it is important to take precautions now and in the months to come like staying home while symptomatic, keeping hands and frequently touched surfaces clean and maintaining distance from anyone you don&#x27;t live with — even with a mask on. Masks, preferably ones that fit snugly and have three layers, are mandatory in indoor public settings in Ontario and Quebec. OPH says residents should also wear masks outside their homes whenever possible. Anyone with COVID-19 symptoms should self-isolate, as should those who&#x27;ve been ordered to do so by their public health unit. The length varies in Ontario and Quebec. Health Canada recommends older adults and people with underlying medical conditions and/or weakened immune systems stay home as much as possible and get friends and family to help with errands. The federal government is in the midst of tightening international travel rules and asks people not to vacation abroad. As of Monday, people will have to show proof of a recent negative COVID-19 test to enter Canada by land without a fine. Symptoms and vaccines COVID-19 can range from a cold-like illness to a severe lung infection, with common symptoms including fever, a cough, vomiting and loss of taste or smell. Children can develop a rash. If you have severe symptoms, call 911. Mental health can also be affected by the pandemic, and resources are available to help. COVID-19 vaccines have been given to local health-care workers and long-term care residents. About 49,500 doses have been given out, including about 34,700 doses in Ottawa and 8,800 in western Quebec Pfizer temporarily slowing its vaccine production to expand its factory means some jurisdictions can&#x27;t guarantee people will get the necessary second dose three weeks after the first. It may take four to six weeks. There is some uncertainty about the Moderna vaccine supply. Ontario&#x27;s first doses are going to care home residents. Ottawa has given a second dose to all but a few long-term care residents, is giving second doses to some health-care workers and by the end of the day, will have given a first dose to high-risk retirement home residents. That province&#x27;s campaign is still expected to expand to priority groups such as older adults and essential workers in March or April, with vaccines widely available in August. Ottawa believes it can have nearly 700,000 residents vaccinated by then, hitting a groove of nearly 11,000 doses a day by early summer. Quebec is also giving a single dose to as many people as possible, starting with people in care homes and health-care workers, then remote communities, then older adults and essential workers and finally the general public. It has had to delay vaccinating people in private seniors&#x27; homes. Quebecers should get their second dose within 90 days. Where to get tested In eastern Ontario: Anyone seeking a test should book an appointment. Ontario recommends only getting tested if you have symptoms, if you&#x27;ve been told to by your health unit or the province, or if you fit certain other criteria. The KFL&amp;A health unit says people that have left southeastern Ontario or been in contact with someone who has should get a test as they track a coronavirus variant. People without symptoms but who are part of the province&#x27;s targeted testing strategy can make an appointment at select pharmacies. Travellers who need a test have very few local options to pay for one. Ottawa has nine permanent test sites, with mobile sites wherever demand is particularly high. People can arrange a test in Picton over the phone or Bancroft, Belleville and Trenton, where online booking is preferred. The Leeds, Grenville and Lanark health unit has permanent sites in Almonte, Brockville, Kemptville and Smiths Falls and a mobile clinic. Renfrew County test clinic locations are posted weekly. Residents can also call their family doctor or 1-844-727-6404 with health questions. Kingston&#x27;s main test site is at the Beechgrove Complex, another is in Napanee. The Eastern Ontario Health Unit has sites in Alexandria, Casselman, Cornwall, Hawkesbury, Rockland and Winchester. In western Quebec: Tests are strongly recommended for people with symptoms and their contacts. Outaouais residents can make an appointment in Gatineau at 135 blvd. Saint-Raymond or 617 ave. Buckingham. They can check the wait time for the Saint-Raymond site. There are recurring clinics by appointment in communities such as Maniwaki, Fort-Coulonge and Petite-Nation.

The territory, through a third-party review panel, will be reviewing all its procurement policies for the first time in a decade to identify what works, what doesn&#x27;t and gather some innovative ideas on how to fix them. The review is also one way the territory is also looking to speed up economic recovery as the COVID-19 pandemic stretches on. Procurement is the process used by the N.W.T. government to buy and contract goods and services. Since January, the third-party review panel has been conducting online consultation sessions on the policy, with the goal of having a list of recommendations in place sometime this summer. As part of that review, the third party panel will be reviewing its Business Incentive Policy, or BIP. The policy gives businesses based in the N.W.T. or who use local employees an advantage in the bidding process, by automatically knocking as much as 20 per cent off their bid on tenders under one million dollars. On contracts over a million dollars, the BIP reduction shrinks to just two per cent for N.W.T.-based businesses with local workers. Jack Rowe, a principal with Rowe&#x27;s Construction, said the decreased benefit on multi-million dollar projects gives southern companies &quot;no incentive&quot; to hire northern workers on multi-million dollar projects. If southern companies spend their first million dollars on northern materials, Rowe said, there is not much benefit to hiring from the North — or even keep spending on northern materials. &quot;You&#x27;ve lost any incentive to hire local people or buy local goods,&quot; Rowe said. The territory notes in its procurement discussion paper that it&#x27;s also &quot;not always clear&quot; which businesses qualify for that reduction. Renee Comeau, executive director of the N.W.T. Chamber of Commerce, said the government should be reviewing which companies are paying payroll taxes and WSCC fees — proof that these companies have employees in the territory. &quot;We&#x27;ve seen a few instances where a company has been [given the reduction] and … they were just a remote office,&quot; Comeau said. &quot;If they don&#x27;t have an N.W.T. payroll tax, it&#x27;s pretty clear they don&#x27;t have employees here. &quot;This is easy information for the government to look into.&quot; Indigenous procurement &#x27;makes sense&#x27; The territory&#x27;s discussion paper &quot;strongly suggests&quot; the creation of an Indigenous procurement strategy. Ernest Betsina, N&#x27;Dilo chief of the Yellowknives Dene First Nation, says that &quot;simply makes sense&quot; for the territory. &quot;We are in the majority, so I&#x27;m hoping the N.W.T. will listen to Indigenous groups,&quot; he said. Last July, the Yellowknives Dene First Nation retracted their support from the Slave Geological Project, a 413-kilometre gravel road between the eastern N.W.T. and western Nunavut, due to issues over procurement. By October, the N.W.T. and the First Nation reached an agreement, although no formal work plan was developed. Paul Gruner, CEO of the Det&#x27;on Cho Corporation, said the government needs to treat First Nations as equal partners earlier on in the development of major projects. &quot;We&#x27;re not going to move forward … with advancing key infrastructure projects of that size if we don&#x27;t have good, meaningful dialogue,&quot; Gruner said, noting the change in government also slowed down the consultation process. There&#x27;s also room for an N.W.T. Indigenous procurement strategy that drives local employment by supporting the creation of small businesses, Betsina said. &quot;We&#x27;re hoping that the money that comes to the community, stays in the community,&quot; Betsina said. Consider what works for Tłı̨chǫ, Yukon in review Comeau said another way to form the N.W.T.&#x27;s procurement strategy is to look elsewhere to see what&#x27;s working. One example is a recent agreement between the Tłı̨chǫ and the N.W.T., which guarantees that 25 per cent of all the labour needed on a local project will be given to the Tłı̨chǫ Investment Corporation and RTL Construction Ltd. The territory also agreed to negotiate directly with the Tłı̨chǫ Government on other infrastructure projects. Garry Bailey, president of the N.W.T. Métis Nation, said this type of agreement should be replicated for other Indigenous governments. &quot;That&#x27;s something the procurement strategy needs to look at for the rest of us, not just one group,&quot; he said. Gruner and Comeau said the N.W.T. could consider replicating what worked in Yukon&#x27;s recent consultation on their new Indigenous procurement policy. &quot;[Yukon&#x27;s review process] was driven by business and Indigenous communities,&quot; Comeau said. &quot;Businesses know what needs to be fixed … we just need to be willing to listen.&quot; Policies need annual review Everyone interviewed for this article agreed that the N.W.T.&#x27;s procurement strategy should be reviewed every few years in order to keep it current. They differ on timelines. Bailey suggests every two years at first to &quot;smooth out any kinks&quot; that might come up. That is also the best way, he said, to make sure a government to government relationship is in place. Minister Wawzonek has not committed to an ongoing timeline for reviewing procurement policies.</p></div></div></div></li><li class="js-stream-content Pos(r)" data-reactid="197"><div class="Py(14px) Pos(r)" data-test-locator="mega" data-reactid="198"><div class="Cf" data-reactid="199"><div class="Ov(h) Pend(14%) Pend(44px)--sm1024" data-reactid="200"><div class="Fz(12px) Fw(b) Tt(c) D(ib) Mb(6px) C($c-fuji-blue-1-a) Mend(9px) Mt(-2px)" data-test-locator="catlabel" data-reactid="201">News</div><div class="C(#959595) Fz(11px) D(ib) Mb(6px)" data-reactid="202">The Canadian Press</div><h3 class="Mb(5px)" data-reactid="203"><a class="js-content-viewer wafer-caas Fw(b) Fz(20px) Lh(23px) Fz(17px)--sm1024 Lh(19px)--sm1024 mega-item-header-link Td(n) C(#0078ff):h C(#000) LineClamp(2,46px) LineClamp(2,38px)--sm1024 not-isInStreamVideoEnabled" href="/2-more-bodies-found-six-101139714.html" data-uuid="8cd776c1-14fb-34c2-8b75-f9660467337b" data-wf-caas-uuid="8cd776c1-14fb-34c2-8b75-f9660467337b" data-wf-caas-prefetch="1" data-reactid="204"><u class="StretchedBox" data-reactid="205"></u><!-- react-text: 206 -->2 more bodies found six weeks after Norway landslide<!-- /react-text --></a></h3><p class="Fz(14px) Lh(19px) Fz(13px)--sm1024 Lh(17px)--sm1024 LineClamp(3,57px) LineClamp(3,51px)--sm1024 M(0)" data-reactid="207">COPENHAGEN — Six weeks after one of the worst landslides in modern Norway’s history, search teams have found two more bodies in the rubble, authorities said. In total, nine bodies have been found so far and one other person is believed to have died in the landslide, which swept away homes in a residential area in the village of Ask on Dec. 30. Last month, authorities said there was no hope of finding survivors and stopped the search in below-freezing temperatures. Helicopters and drones with heat-detecting cameras had flown over the ravaged hillside in Ask, which has a population of around 5,000 residents and is part of the Gjerdrum municipality. The landslide destroyed at least nine buildings with more than 30 apartments in the village, located 25 kilometres (16 miles) northeast of Oslo. After the two latest bodies were found, police spokeswoman Mari Stoltenberg said late Tuesday there was now an increased hope of finding the last missing person. Stoltenberg said the victims, which haven&#x27;t been identified yet, were found under two meters (more than six feet) of quick clay, which can rapidly change from solid to liquid form when it is disturbed. The exact cause of the landslide isn’t yet known. However, combined with excessive precipitation and damp winter weather, the quick clay may have contributed to the landslide. In 2005, Norwegian authorities warned people not to construct residential buildings in the Ask area, saying it was “a high-risk zone” for landslides, but houses were built there later in the decade. A landslide in central Norway in 1893 killed 116 people. It was reportedly up to 40 times bigger than the one in Ask, where somewhere between 1.4 million and 2 million cubic meters (49.4 million to 70.6 million cubic feet) of land tumbled down.

Some might have noticed work vans and trucks coming and going from the Mulgrave Road Theatre’s (MRT’s) RoadHouse property on Highway 16, Guysborough. These vehicles are signs that phase one of the development plan for this location is moving forward. Phase one of the two-phase plan involves reconfiguring the existing space for use as a temporary theatre. This involves creating a seating arrangement, an entrance and exit for patrons, as well as designated areas for actors offstage. Work on security, communication and accessibility features at the RoadHouse have been ongoing this fall and winter. Phase two, which may begin as early as this summer, will include an addition and further renovations to the existing building. The firm Solterre Design of Halifax has been commissioned to create the schematic design for phase two, the completion of Mulgrave Road Theatre’s vision for the RoadHouse. The preliminary plans for the RoadHouse include, but are not limited to: a theatre space, offices, bathrooms and lobby. While the future of live productions remains uncertain due to the pandemic, a script continues to be in development by Mary-Colin Chisholm based on the 1829 Guysborough murder mystery involving the death of Dr. Henry Inch. MRT’s Artist Director Emmy Alcorn told The Journal on Monday (Feb. 8), “We are exploring all of our options with the hope that we can present something this summer.” Alcorn noted that although numerous public health restrictions regarding COVID-19 have been lifted this week, there’s much planning and preparation that needs to be done before any production can be announced with certainty. Work on the RoadHouse renovation project has been funded in part by ACOA, Canadian Heritage and Nova Scotia Communities, Culture and Heritage.

We are from a small town. so everyone&#x27;s really close.&quot; Because of the pandemic, high schools in New Brunswick have been required to implement a blended learning model, with the student population alternating between in-person classes and at-home learning every other day. That means some students have been separated from their friends. &quot;I was most looking forward to just the day-to-day stuff like sitting with your friends on the bench in the morning, or just going out to lunch with everyone, but now you don&#x27;t even see half your grad class or half your friends, even at school,&quot; said one student, who was interviewed for the documentary. Melvin said the blended model has also affected the quality of the education she and her peers are getting, which has led to concerns over being accepted to university or college. &quot;Math and sciences, they&#x27;re easy enough to separate the curriculum online and in school.&quot; she said. &quot;But for arts classes and more of the electives, they&#x27;re harder to do at home, so you&#x27;re really not getting any substance in the class.&quot; Balancing restrictions with mental health worries Student mental health is an issue the Department of Education takes seriously, but the blended learning model for high school students will remain in place, said Education Minister Dominic Cardy. In an interview Tuesday, he said concern for student mental health is the reason he pushed to keep schools open as much as possible throughout the pandemic, in order to give students as much opportunity to interact with their peers. Cardy said the department is also working to provide additional counselling services and accelerate work to expand the range of options for student mental health supports. &quot;COVID-19 is obviously the number one concern, but the mental health concerns are number two, and that&#x27;s part of the reason that I&#x27;ve been very strong in trying to push the schools to remain open as much as possible. &quot;As long as Public Health tells me that it&#x27;s safe, I want the schools to be open for exactly those reasons, that absolutely the academic concerns are there as well, but this is a year when around the world schooling has been completely upset.&quot; Pandemic coincides with pivotal developmental period High school students are particularly prone to being affected by the changes that have been brought on by the pandemic, said Dr. Sarah Dow-Fleisner, an assistant professor in the school of social work at the University of British Columbia&#x27;s Okanagan campus. &quot;Adolescents are in a really unique developmental stage,&quot; Dow-Fleisner said. &quot;This is really the fist time when we think of cognitive development, that they have some of the abilities now to think really abstractly, to have some complex ways of thinking, so they&#x27;re recognizing more than young children that this has long-lasting impacts.&quot; They&#x27;re also at a stage where they&#x27;re typically moving away from identifying with family groups, and gravitating instead to peer groups. However, that natural development has been &quot;roadblocked&quot; by the pandemic and the restrictions they have to live with at school and in the community. &quot;They&#x27;re staying at home. They&#x27;re not necessarily having those peer interactions that are informal.&quot; Coping with an unusual year It&#x27;s important for teachers and parents to offer consistent messaging to adolescents on the importance of mask-wearing, hand hygiene and social distancing to keep them and their community safe, Dow-Fleisner said. At the same time, simple practices such as maintaining a routine can help students feel a sense of normalcy even amid the other changes, she said. &quot;One of the biggest losses by not going to school regularly is a lack of routine. This can lead to poor sleeping habits and sedentary behaviour, all of which can affect mental health. &quot;So finding a way to keep a routine [is important] even if you have an online class.&quot;</p></div></div></div></li><li class="js-stream-content Pos(r)" data-reactid="233"><div class="Py(14px) Pos(r)" data-test-locator="mega" data-reactid="234"><div class="Cf" data-reactid="235"><div class="Fl(start) Pos(r) Mt(2px) W(26.5%) Maw(220px)" data-reactid="236"><div class="H(0) Ov(h) Bdrs(2px)" style="padding-bottom:56%;" data-reactid="237"><img srcset="https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/.9MA9zlji6wEsYMZAIx8xA--~B/Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0xMjM7cT04MDt3PTIyMDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/gfSz0SIgzmOXgQ38W8041g--~B/aD0zNDk7dz02MjA7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cbc.ca/341fca87682a7bcf5929e330ecc0827f.cf.jpg 1x,https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/xxtzSPeUKdY7YLCF0lKQ8w--~B/Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0yNDY7cT04MDt3PTQ0MDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/gfSz0SIgzmOXgQ38W8041g--~B/aD0zNDk7dz02MjA7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cbc.ca/341fca87682a7bcf5929e330ecc0827f.cf.jpg 2x" class=" W(100%) Trsdu(0s)!

Two of them are screaming at her. They want to leave the ER. They&#x27;re homeless. She&#x27;s scrambling to find them a place in Winnipeg where they can self-isolate. Meanwhile, an elderly woman has been rushed in from a personal care home unable to breathe. Her COVID-19 symptoms are so severe, the nurse has been told the woman will die. &quot;You just look at it and go like, &#x27;I can&#x27;t. I&#x27;m one person,&#x27;&quot; the nurse told CBC News later, through tears. &quot;How do you decide where to go? How do you decide who to look after?&quot; She knew if she didn&#x27;t stop the first two patients who were homeless from leaving the ER, they could spread COVID-19 in the community. She had no choice but to leave the elderly patient, she said. &quot;To know that there was someone dying alone in a room, and there was no help — no one was with her. I&#x27;ve never had a day like that before,&quot; the nurse said. &quot;It still bothers me,&quot; she said. &quot;I just keep thinking if that was a family member of mine.&quot; CBC News interviewed 10 emergency room nurses who work in Winnipeg and surrounding areas and say they feel abandoned by Manitoba&#x27;s Department of Health and their own union. CBC has agreed to withhold their names because they fear they could lose their jobs for speaking out In December, the province signed a deal with the Manitoba Nurses Union to provide a temporary pay bump to nurses working in intensive care, COVID-19 wards, and personal care homes. The emergency room nurses were left out of the deal. &quot;The [agreement] completely disregarded emergency,&quot; one nurse said. &quot;Our union didn&#x27;t even acknowledge that that had happened.&quot; After that, more than 200 ER nurses signed a letter to the province and their union looking for more support. The nurses CBC News spoke to said those concerns have been ignored. They have now taken their concerns to politicians with Manitoba&#x27;s Opposition NDP as well as CBC, hoping the public will demand the province do more to support them. &#x27;This place sucks the soul out of you&#x27; The nurses CBC interviewed for this story work at emergency rooms in Winnipeg&#x27;s St. Boniface Hospital, Health Sciences Centre and Grace Hospital, as well as the Selkirk Regional Health Centre just north of the city. They say they face serious risks in the pandemic the public might not be aware of. Most patients enter the hospital through the emergency department. That means ER nurses often screen, test, and treat people for COVID-19 before they are triaged elsewhere. And unlike those working in intensive care units (ICUs) or COVID wards, ER nurses don&#x27;t know whether someone being rushed into their care has the virus or not. They&#x27;ll do CPR not knowing whether the person they are trying to save is infectious, they said. &quot;They&#x27;ve got their faces down doing compressions on a patient. You&#x27;re probably six inches away from their face while you&#x27;re doing this. So you&#x27;re high, high risk,&quot; one nurse said. Some ER nurses with more than a dozen years of experience say they&#x27;ve never dealt with this many severely ill patients at a time — or this much death. When someone dies, the nurses said they don&#x27;t have time to comfort families — they have to run to the next emergency. &quot;It is heart-wrenching to hear people grieve … I&#x27;m embarrassed with the way we care for these people&#x27;s families,&quot; one nurse said. &quot;This place sucks the soul out of you,&quot; another added. I&#x27;m embarrassed with the way we care for these people&#x27;s families. - Winnipeg emergency room nurse Many are now required to work 16-hour shifts to make sure the emergency department is staffed. &quot;Do you want to come to emergency and know that 90 per cent of the nurses there are on their 15th hour of work? I wouldn&#x27;t,&quot; one said. &quot;It&#x27;s not safe for the patients.&quot; $6 extra an hour The last time Manitoba&#x27;s nurses were given a pay raise was four years ago — long before they were fighting a pandemic. The Manitoba Nurses Union has been without a contract with the Department of Health since March 2017. When the union signed the temporary pay increase for some nurses in December, it allowed the province to change those nurses&#x27; assignments, shifts, and work locations to deal with the pandemic. &quot;As emergency departments are not currently an area where staff are being redeployed, they were not included in the [agreement],&quot; a spokesperson for the province wrote in an email. Emergency room nurses say the deal amounts to $6 an hour extra — a hike they are happy to see their colleagues in other departments get, but one they say all frontline nurses deserve. The union said it tried to get the ER nurses included in the wage increase, but the province told them they only had a certain amount of funding. ER nurses quitting Emergency room nurses say they are now making difficult decisions about a job they love. &quot;There are a lot of days now for myself that I question, do I want to be an emergency nurse still? That is really hard,&quot; one nurse said. &quot;We have lost so many of our very good senior staff members to take other jobs, [because] they need to not feel like they&#x27;re failing as a nurse in this profession, when it&#x27;s really because we just don&#x27;t have the resources,&quot; another said. The NDP&#x27;s Health critic said this could leave a lasting mark on Manitoba&#x27;s health-care system as the pandemic drags on — and for years to come. &quot;These are folks who have a tremendous amount of training and education and commitment to doing this work. So it&#x27;s a huge loss if and when they walk away. And I know the nurses have walked away,&quot; Uzoma Asagwara said. &quot;They&#x27;ve reached their breaking point.&quot; The province said its making efforts throughout the system to make sure nurses are supported, but did not elaborate on what those are. &quot;Nurses across the health-care system are making valuable contributions to our COVID-19 fight and we thank them for their professionalism and commitment to providing outstanding care during this unprecedented time,&quot; a provincial spokesperson wrote in an email to CBC. The 10 ER nurses said it&#x27;s hurtful to hear the Manitoba government praise them in writing, but not hear their concerns or provide a clear plan to support them. &quot;We&#x27;re really not superheroes, actually,&quot; one nurse said. &quot;We&#x27;re really just humans, just like everyone else. And we do have a threshold. And there&#x27;s only so much that one person can do.&quot; We&#x27;re really not superheroes, actually. We&#x27;re really just humans. - Winnipeg emergency room nurse</p></div></div></div></li><li class="js-stream-content Pos(r)" data-reactid="247"><div class="Py(14px) Pos(r)" data-test-locator="mega" data-reactid="248"><div class="Cf" data-reactid="249"><div class="Fl(start) Pos(r) Mt(2px) W(26.5%) Maw(220px)" data-reactid="250"><div class="H(0) Ov(h) Bdrs(2px)" style="padding-bottom:56%;" data-reactid="251"><img srcset="https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/GsrCnvsTkobG4_h4PkmCSg--~B/Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0xMjM7cT04MDt3PTIyMDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/CwIBsoU2bHNTl9TjK09..A--~B/aD01MzM7dz04MDA7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/reuters.com/81c8164e0c03ad8185f36f179ecb232a.cf.jpg 1x,https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/oeCqav5UrKfKz90p1c37tQ--~B/Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0yNDY7cT04MDt3PTQ0MDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/CwIBsoU2bHNTl9TjK09..A--~B/aD01MzM7dz04MDA7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/reuters.com/81c8164e0c03ad8185f36f179ecb232a.cf.jpg 2x" class=" W(100%) Trsdu(0s)!

In recent weeks, ultra-Orthodox Jews have defied coronavirus restrictions by holding big funerals for beloved rabbis who died of COVID-19, celebrating large weddings, and continuing to send their children to schools. The gatherings have led to clashes with police and an unprecedented wave of public anger toward the religious community. On Tuesday night, hundreds of ultra-Orthodox demonstrators protested lockdown restrictions, set dumpsters on fire, and faced off with police officers in Jerusalem. Moskowits, like many other ultra-Orthodox faithful, says Israeli society doesn&#x27;t understand their way of life and has turned his community into a scapegoat. “The media gives us, in my opinion, a very bad misrepresentation,” he said. The ultra-Orthodox community makes up about 12% of Israel’s 9.3 million people. Gilad Malach, a researcher at the Israel Democracy Institute, says ultra-Orthodox believers accounted for over a third of the country’s COVID-19 cases in 2020. Among Israelis over 65, the community&#x27;s mortality rate was three times that of the general population, he added. Health Ministry data show vaccination rates in ultra-Orthodox areas lag far behind the national average. But the ultra-Orthodox community has wielded outsize influence, using its kingmaker status in parliament to secure benefits and generous government subsidies. Ultra-Orthodox men are exempt from compulsory military service and often collect welfare payments while continuing to study full time in seminaries throughout adulthood. Their schools enjoy broad autonomy and focus almost entirely on religion while shunning basic subjects like math and science. These privileges have generated disdain from the general public — resentment that has boiled over into outright hostility during the coronavirus crisis. Ultra-Orthodox noncompliance, Malach said, stemmed in part from members not believing that they &quot;need to obey the rules of the state, especially regarding questions of religious behaviour.” Ultra-Orthodox, also known as “Haredim,” follow a strict interpretation of Judaism, and prominent rabbis are the community’s arbiters in all matters. Many consider secular Israelis a recent aberration from centuries of unaltered Jewish tradition. “We have rabbis. We don’t just do what we have in our minds,” Moskowits said. “We have listened to them for a few thousand years. We will listen to them today as well.” While the ultra-Orthodox community is far from monolithic, many rabbis have either ignored or even intentionally flouted safety rules. The 93-year-old Rabbi Chaim Kanievsky, one of the most influential spiritual leaders, has insisted schools remain open throughout the crisis. On a recent day, scores of ultra-Orthodox girls cascaded from a grade school in the Romema neighbourhood that was operating in violation of the law. Few wore masks or maintained distance from others. Classes went on at nearby boys’ elementary schools and yeshivas. “We can’t have a generation go bust,” said Moskowits, who lives in Romema. “We are still sending our boys to school because we have rabbis who say Torah study saves and protects.&quot; In a community that largely shuns the internet, rabbis plaster “pashkevils,” or public notices, on walls in religious neighbourhoods to spread their messages. Some notices urged people not to get vaccinated, even using Holocaust imagery to scare people. “The vaccine is completely unnecessary! The pandemic is already behind us!” one read, comparing the rush for vaccinations to boarding a train to the Auschwitz death camp. Ultra-Orthodox leaders say such views are held by a radical minority. Most people respect safety rules, they say, and the virus is spreading because communities are poor and people live in small apartments with large families. Moskowits, a 29-year-old father of two, said some families have up to 10 children and just one bathroom. From 14, boys are sent to boarding schools and spend only the sabbath at home. For many, lockdown “technically, physically doesn’t work,” Moskowits said. He called it a “human rights violation.” Moskowits, who grew up in the U.K., speaks English with a British accent, but his vocabulary is heavily seasoned with Yiddish and Hebrew words. He wears the black velvet skullcap, pressed white shirt and black slacks typical of ultra-Orthodox men -- but no mask, despite the government requiring them in public. He said he contracted COVID-19 in March and claims a letter from his doctor excuses him from wearing a mask. A real estate developer, he punctuates his workday with prayers at a neighbourhood synagogue, and tries once a week to pray at Jerusalem&#x27;s Western Wall, the holiest place where Jews can worship. Once a day, he performs ablutions at a mikvah, a Jewish ritual bath, and he regularly studies religious texts with a partner. The religious community is growing rapidly even though economists have long warned that the system is unsustainable. About 60% of its population is under 19, according to the Israel Democracy Institute. Protecting the ultra-Orthodox way of life — or Yiddishkeit — is the community’s ultimate aim. If that means infections spread, that’s a price some members are willing to pay. Ultra-Orthodox people “sacrifice most of their lives for the next generation and for preserving Yiddishkeit. We give away everything,” Moskowits said. This view is hardly universal. Nathan Slifkin, an Orthodox rabbi living in Israel, complained in a recent op-ed in the Jewish Chronicle that members of the Haredi community “genuinely see no connection between flouting the restrictions and people dying from COVID.” Yehuda Meshi-Zahav, head of an ultra-Orthodox ambulance service called ZAKA, lost both his parents to the virus in January. He says rabbis urging followers to violate coronavirus regulations have “blood on their hands.” Funerals play a central role in traditional Jewish life, and the pandemic has made them all too common. Cars with megaphones drive through religious neighbourhoods announcing deaths and funeral details. Pashkevils notify communities when a prominent rabbi dies. Shmuel Gelbstein, deputy director of a Jerusalem funeral society for the ultra-Orthodox community, said this year has been “very busy, very difficult regarding mortality, both when it comes to ordinary deaths, plus of course coronavirus, which is certainly an amount that adds to the load.” Funerals for two leading Haredi rabbis who died of COVID-19 each drew an estimated 10,000 mourners last week. Israel’s non-Orthodox majority was outraged at what they saw as contempt for the rules and selective enforcement by authorities. But the ultra-Orthodox claim they are being unfairly singled out, noting that demonstrations against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu -- protected under free speech laws -- have been permitted to continue during the pandemic. Moskowits explained that for the young men who flocked to these funerals, prominent rabbis are “a huge part of your life.” “When these younger guys go to a funeral, they feel that their father died,” he said. “Nothing stands in the way. He will go to the funeral anyway.” Ilan Ben Zion, The Associated Press</p></div></div></div></li><li class="js-stream-content Pos(r)" data-reactid="275"><div class="Py(14px) Pos(r)" data-test-locator="mega" data-reactid="276"><div class="Cf" data-reactid="277"><div class="Fl(start) Pos(r) Mt(2px) W(26.5%) Maw(220px)" data-reactid="278"><div class="H(0) Ov(h) Bdrs(2px)" style="padding-bottom:56%;" data-reactid="279"><img srcset="https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/TjNnIURWlRA6p5l5rl8xbQ--~B/Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0xMjM7cT04MDt3PTIyMDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/HEI0P_dxGqbdeyhORzoy5Q--~B/aD00MzM7dz02NTA7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cp.org/cc8e1562212b61c1977feeeaf0e164fb.cf.jpg 1x,https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/r6FST5J8FJJRrpHU1XP7LA--~B/Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0yNDY7cT04MDt3PTQ0MDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/HEI0P_dxGqbdeyhORzoy5Q--~B/aD00MzM7dz02NTA7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cp.org/cc8e1562212b61c1977feeeaf0e164fb.cf.jpg 2x" class=" W(100%) Trsdu(0s)!

Chad Gaffield, a history professor at the University of Ottawa, says the collections of Library and Archives Canada are the foundations of understanding Canada&#x27;s history and without them research in the field is impossible. Before the lockdown in Ontario, researchers could make appointments at Library and Archives Canada building in Ottawa to view documents in its reading room but the building doors have now been closed for weeks. &quot;That&#x27;s going to, inevitably, have a have an impact on which projects can be done now and which projects are going to have to wait,&quot; Gaffield said. Johanna Smith, Library and Archives Canada&#x27;s director general of public services, said decisions on public access to the collections have been aligned throughout the pandemic with public health advice that varies across the country. On-site services are now closed in Ottawa and Winnipeg, but they are available to the public in Vancouver with social distancing measures in place. In Halifax, Library and Archives Canada&#x27;s public service point at the Pier 21 Museum will be closed until April due to renovations. Greg Bak, a history professor at the University of Manitoba, said his students often have assignments that require them to use archives. &quot;It&#x27;s been challenging,&quot; he said. Still, Bak said they have been able to make a transition to online teaching using video calls to conduct virtual archives tours for students. &quot;The local archival community has been tremendously helpful and supportive,&quot; he said. Gaffield said some research projects require researchers to spend long days looking at archival materials at Library and Archives Canada. &quot;I did a project, some years ago, and we actually ... were there physically every day for two years,&quot; he said. Library and Archives Canada is also dealing with a backlog of access to information requests. &quot;We had a long queue of requests before the pandemic started,&quot; Smith said. &quot;Because staff were working from home, they couldn&#x27;t come in and contact the collections.&quot; She said other government departments can answer access to information requests because they&#x27;re mostly digital. The backlog is a result of both the lack of human resources required to process the requests and the increasing interest in government records, Smith said. The requests are known as &quot;ATIPs,&quot; for the access to information and privacy acts that govern them. &quot;That increase, it goes up by at least 50 per cent to 100 per cent every year. We&#x27;ve seen those increases since about 2015 onwards,&quot; she said. &quot;We&#x27;ve kind of done a sort of review across government of how ATIP budgets are allocated and we know that we&#x27;re giving a lot already to ATIP, and we just need more.&quot; She said the COVID-19 pandemic has shown the need to digitize the collections faster. Smith said Library and Archives Canada doesn&#x27;t have a dedicated digitization budget, but there are programs every year to digitize as much material as possible. &quot;We try to focus on where things are the most popular, but it&#x27;s still a small amount of what we need to do,&quot; she said. Smith said the holdings of Library and Archives Canada amount to about 250 kilometres of shelves full of archival documents stored in Vancouver, Winnipeg, Ottawa, Gatineau, Que. and Renfrew, Ont. New storage vaults are being built in Gatineau next to the current preservation centre there. &quot;We think the world has gone digital but we still get transfers of paper records every year from notable Canadians, from the government, from publishers who transfer us collections,&quot; she said. &quot;The move to digital is coming slowly in terms of the collections that we&#x27;re getting.&quot; Bak said digitizing the archival documents of Library and Archives Canada is problematic. He said academics often need to access documents no one has looked at before. &quot;What is the cost-benefit here in terms of digitizing these record sets, which may only be used by a small handful of academic researchers?&quot; he said. Digitization also presents legal complications as entire classes of records cannot be copied and circulated due to laws around copyright, legitimate government secrecy, and privacy. &quot;Indigenous communities have been effectively under government surveillance for hundreds of years, and the records of this surveillance are government records ... Opening up these records would deprive Indigenous people of their privacy unfairly,&quot; he said. Digitizing the archival materials also will create a double burden for preservation because there will be a need to preserve both the original records and the new digital versions. &quot;Digital technologies are always changing, so maintaining the physical copies requires ongoing monitoring for data loss, data degradation and obsolescence. And then migrating them into new formats as formats become obsolete,&quot; he said.

Ella is one of the more than 7,100 students now at home, as the Newfoundland and Labrador English School District has suspended classes at 12 of its schools in the St. John&#x27;s area for at least Tuesday and Wednesday in the wake of two students testing positive at Mount Pearl Senior High on the weekend. Three other schools in the metro area outside the NLESD&#x27;s jurisdiction have also followed suit. As relieved as Ella was, she wasn&#x27;t surprised by the closure. She has multiple friends in isolation at the moment, having been identified as close contacts, she said, with anxiety and stress for them and for herself building, and hard to keep at bay. &quot;You&#x27;re just waiting for the call. Like you never know if you&#x27;re going to be the next one, and it feels like you&#x27;re walking on thin ice,&quot; she said. Ella knows what&#x27;s at stake. Her grandmother tested positive for COVID-19 in the spring, after travelling home from Florida, an experience that has stuck with her long after her grandmother&#x27;s recovery. She&#x27;s been following the public health guidelines, she said, but simply being at school makes that practically impossible. &quot;It&#x27;s hard to keep your bubble to 20 people when they&#x27;re going to school with like 600 people,&quot; she said, adding that there has also been a lot of overlap between high schools via activities like sports teams. Online learning welcomed Teachers and staff at all affected NLESD schools — save Mount Pearl Senior High, where everyone remains in isolation — reported to work Tuesday to begin preparations for a potential move to online learning, although no guidelines on if or when that could happen have been made public. Ella said she would welcome a temporary move to learning from home. &quot;I think the teachers will know how to make it work, and I have belief in all the teachers,&quot; she said. Abby Mitchell, a Grade 12 student at Holy Spirit, also wants to see a shift to online learning. It may be at a crucial point of studies for her, in the final months of her final year, but she believes the plans the district has made so far for this possibility will work. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s an unreasonable ask, to be protected. - Sarah Healey &quot;I think that as a province, we&#x27;re in this together, and we&#x27;re actually ahead of other provinces in the country. So I think we&#x27;re going to be OK. I fully trust my teachers,&quot; said Abby, who is also the school&#x27;s student council president. Both Abby and Ella are set up with their own personal laptops and devices to be able to pivot to online classes, but they know of other students who aren&#x27;t so fortunate. &quot;I know it&#x27;s definitely a stress factor,&quot; said Abby. &quot;We were told we were all going to have Chromebooks at the start of the year, and we&#x27;re in the second semester now, and very few of us have actually received that.&quot; The CEO of the NLESD, Tony Stack, said Tuesday there has been a delay in getting Chromebooks to the province due to a worldwide shortage but students who need technology have been identified and tech solutions found. Keep schools closed, say students On Tuesday, public health confirmed community transmission is occurring in the St. John&#x27;s area, as 30 new cases of COVID-19 were reported in the province: all in the Eastern Health region, with 14 of them under the age of 19. No new school cases were identified outside Mount Pearl Senior, said Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Janice Fitzgerald. She did not say if the current school closures would be extended, but said public health and the school district are working closely together, as other community restrictions outside classrooms have come into effect for two weeks. &quot;As the information changes, we may have to change our response with that, but we are trying to reduce spread through the community. If we keep our community safe, we can keep our schools safe,&quot; Fitzgerald said. The idea of a return to school sooner than two weeks — the incubation period of the virus — doesn&#x27;t sit well with Gonzaga High Grade 10 student Kaitlin Healey. &quot;I think it was smart of them to close the high schools, but I feel like everything should be closed for a 14-day period … at minimum,&quot; Kaitlin said. &quot;I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s an unreasonable ask, to be protected,&quot; said her sister Sarah Healey, in Grade 11. All the students CBC News spoke to urged public health officials to not rush back to school. Kaitlin said it comes down to safety: she knows first-hand what it feels like to be in a crowded classroom where other students have their masks pushed down past their noses or chins. &quot;I don&#x27;t feel safe going into a classroom with like 30 to 40 other children, and about 20 to 30 the kids aren&#x27;t wearing their masks properly,&quot; she said. Balancing those physical risks are mental ones. &quot;It&#x27;s very difficult to deal with the last-minute snap of things,&quot; said Sarah, of the consecutive late-night closure announcements from the school district. The teenagers are gifted with technological literacy, and are using it to their advantage amid the uncertainty to try to take care of themselves, and their friends. Abby said she&#x27;s been FaceTiming her best friend constantly, while Ella said she&#x27;s also keeping up contacts, but trying to avoid negativity online. Her advice for getting through it works for any age. &quot;I&#x27;m trying to stay away from sources I don&#x27;t know, and just take it day by day and listen to all the health professionals,&quot; Ella said. She hopes the health professionals are listening to students like her, and what they hope to see in the coming days: staying home, with their families. &quot;I just think that being in school right now is just one of the worst possible things, because every couple of minutes someone else is texting, being like, &#x27;I have to isolate,&#x27;&quot; said Ella. &quot;If we were all in school right now, we&#x27;d have so many more cases.&quot; Read more from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador</p></div></div></div></li><li class="js-stream-content Pos(r)" data-reactid="303"><div class="Py(14px) Pos(r)" data-test-locator="mega" data-reactid="304"><div class="Cf" data-reactid="305"><div class="Fl(start) Pos(r) Mt(2px) W(26.5%) Maw(220px)" data-reactid="306"><div class="H(0) Ov(h) Bdrs(2px)" style="padding-bottom:56%;" data-reactid="307"><img srcset="https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/4PUKYZyXngySbgveP6rApw--~B/Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0xMjM7cT04MDt3PTIyMDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/wyEvhYDEaf81WF2I2dDSiQ--~B/aD00MTM7dz02MjA7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cbc.ca/17a038c6855149c04a2c8bf878d27679.cf.jpg 1x,https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/QqBeW.U5_tXmWNSCKCe7kQ--~B/Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0yNDY7cT04MDt3PTQ0MDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/wyEvhYDEaf81WF2I2dDSiQ--~B/aD00MTM7dz02MjA7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cbc.ca/17a038c6855149c04a2c8bf878d27679.cf.jpg 2x" class=" W(100%) Trsdu(0s)!

Sixteen years later, she&#x27;s hearing from friends on the ground who fear COVID-19 will be a worse pandemic. &quot;They&#x27;re telling me they&#x27;re scared,&quot; said Warren, who maintains contact with community leaders in the region of Manzini. A high school that she visited in 2005 has been closed for most of the past year. The principal, Bheki Zwane, says he has no way to check on the welfare of his students. They have no access to the internet or phones, he said, and many relied on the school for their main, maybe only, meal of the day. &quot;A lot of these children are coming from child-headed homes,&quot; said Zwane. &quot;They don&#x27;t have a mother. They don&#x27;t have a father.&quot; Of the 860 students enrolled at Zombodze National High School, 500 are classified as orphans or vulnerable because they lack the basic needs for survival. &quot;And we don&#x27;t even know how they&#x27;re coping,&quot; he said. HIV positive patients at risk In 2018, the king of Swaziland renamed the country Eswatini. Today, it has the highest rate of HIV infection in the world. Nearly a third of the adult population is HIV positive. &quot;We thought we would never see a pandemic that would square with HIV,&quot; said Thandi Nhlengethwa, executive director of the AIDS Information and Support Centre. &quot;Then COVID was on our doorstep.&quot; In the past few months, COVID has been linked to the deaths of two Eswatini cabinet ministers, the country&#x27;s Anglican bishop and its 52-year-old prime minister. Nhlengethwa says patients can live with HIV for many years but COVID seems to be killing her compatriots quickly. &quot;With COVID, you&#x27;re dead in the space of maybe 14 days,&quot; she said. Now she&#x27;s worried to what extent healthcare resources will be diverted to managing this newest threat. &quot;We can&#x27;t have a patient default on HIV treatment. That is suicide,&quot; she said. No vaccine Dr. Bernhard Kerschberger says there&#x27;s been a lot of pressure to put more resources into the COVID response. As project manager with Médecins Sans Frontières in Eswatini, Kerschberger has been occupied with HIV and the country&#x27;s high burden of tuberculosis. In 2011, the government declared TB a national emergency. &quot;We can see it&#x27;s very difficult now for the health system to actually cope with this triple pandemic -- HIV, TB and corona,&quot; said Kerschberger. Still, he&#x27;s optimistic that COVID vaccine will start arriving later this month through the COVAX initiative. That&#x27;s a program that was launched last year by the World Health Organization. It was created in part so wealthier countries could help drive vaccine development with the expectation that lower income countries would later benefit. Canada is a participant, having invested $440 million, half of which paid to secure vaccine for Canadians. The other half will help buy doses for the 92 countries that do need help. &quot;In Africa, almost no countries have received the vaccine so far,&quot; said Kershberger. &quot;And I think it&#x27;s a bit sad to see because at the beginning of the pandemic, there was a lot of talk about a global approach, about solidarity ... but at the moment, I don&#x27;t think we see a lot of solidarity.&quot; In an interview from Mbabane, the country&#x27;s executive capital, on Tuesday, Kerschberger said he expected Eswatini would be getting the AstraZeneca vaccine. A few hours later, Reuters reported that Eswatini was rejecting that vaccine. The decision was made after a trial showed it gave minimal protection against mild-to-moderate COVID-19 caused by the dominant variant in South Africa.</p></div></div></div></li><li class="js-stream-content Pos(r)" data-reactid="317"><div class="Py(14px) Pos(r)" data-test-locator="mega" data-reactid="318"><div class="Cf" data-reactid="319"><div class="Fl(start) Pos(r) Mt(2px) W(26.5%) Maw(220px)" data-reactid="320"><div class="H(0) Ov(h) Bdrs(2px)" style="padding-bottom:56%;" data-reactid="321"><img srcset="https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/qv2JDRtQmoCkafvqkkWaFw--~B/Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0xMjM7cT04MDt3PTIyMDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/LyW5pDu8fgxgqevFFzaD_Q--~B/aD00NDA7dz02MjA7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cbc.ca/34ef7840dc9770097d0e64e86231aea8.cf.jpg 1x,https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/_gX2HEUt.3lYt8KnEpGRew--~B/Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0yNDY7cT04MDt3PTQ0MDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/LyW5pDu8fgxgqevFFzaD_Q--~B/aD00NDA7dz02MjA7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cbc.ca/34ef7840dc9770097d0e64e86231aea8.cf.jpg 2x" class=" W(100%) Trsdu(0s)!

Brenda O&#x27;Reilly, who chairs Hospitality Newfoundland and Labrador&#x27;s board of directors, agrees. &quot;Right now I implore all businesses in tourism and hospitality to look to the protocols that the public health has put out there and to adhere to them and to enforce them to help get COVID-19 under control,&quot; she said. Coady and O&#x27;Reilly were responding to an expanded special measures order imposed Tuesday afternoon as Dr. Janice Fitzgerald, the province&#x27;s chief medical officer of health, announced a spike in cases, likely associated with a cluster that involves a high school in Mount Pearl. 30 new cases in a single day The order required bars in the St. John&#x27;s region to close their doors as of midnight Tuesday, for at least two weeks, and for restaurants to reduce their capacity to 50 per cent. Establishments that serve food and alcohol can remain open. The expanded measures are in response to 30 new cases reported on Tuesday, bringing the total number of active cases in the province to 57. N.L. had reported 11 cases on Monday. Tuesday&#x27;s numbers represented the second-highest single-day total since the start of the pandemic, and was only surpassed by the 32 cases announced March 25 during the province&#x27;s first wave. Fitzgerald confirmed that there is now community transmission in the area, and that she expects more cases to be discovered in the coming days. In an attempt to contain the outbreak, Fitzgerald announced a series of measures she described as a &quot;circuit breaker.&quot; WATCH | Here &amp; Now&#x27;s Peter Cowan and Carolyn Stokes find answers to some key questions about the changing COVID-19 situation: For example, gatherings may not exceed 20 people, all group activities are suspended, and gyms and recreational facilities must close. Retail stores and malls can remain open, as well as personal service and animal grooming businesses. After months of very low numbers of the virus, the situation has rapidly changed, and the level of anxiety and fear that was so common during the early days of the pandemic has returned. And for the hospitality industry, it&#x27;s another setback for a sector that has been struggling through unprecedented problems. If there&#x27;s any upside for bars and restaurants, it&#x27;s that the new measures come at a time when business is already lean because it&#x27;s mid-winter, and many people were already staying away because of fear of the virus. &quot;It&#x27;s sad to see any part of our sector close, but two weeks? Better the middle of February than the middle of July,&quot; said O&#x27;Reilly. &quot;All we want is to make sure that what has been happening can even out [and] for this to go away so everyone is front row centre to participate in every way possible to help make that happen,&quot; added Coady.

Here is what&#x27;s on the radar of our editors for the morning of Feb. 10 ... What we are watching in Canada ... A Montreal cardiologist with a background in epidemiology says even with community spread of COVID-19 in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland and Labrador can have a safe election on Saturday. McGill University professor Dr. Christopher Labos says it&#x27;s not the election itself that&#x27;s a concern but the possibility of people gathering in large numbers. Labos said Tuesday if venues are ventilated and if voters are masked and keep their distance from one another, then everything should be fine. Newfoundlanders and Labradorians will be heading to the polls days after health officials confirmed community spread of COVID-19 in the capital&#x27;s metro region. And although officials announced stricter health measures in St. John&#x27;s, shutting gyms, cinemas and bars, the chief electoral officer said Tuesday that voting day was still a go. Chief medical officer of health Dr. Janice Fitzgerald said Tuesday that going to a polling station where safety protocols are followed is no riskier than visiting a grocery store.--- Also this ... A judge is to hear arguments this week over whether Alberta&#x27;s public inquiry into the purported foreign funding of environmental charities is a valid defence of the province&#x27;s ailing oil industry or an attempt to silence dissent. Court of Queen&#x27;s Bench Justice Karen Horner is to hear a challenge from environmental law charity Ecojustice on Thursday and Friday. The hearing&#x27;s initial April date was delayed because of the COVID-19 pandemic. &quot;I can&#x27;t recall an issue that has prompted so much public interest in recent times for an Ecojustice case, and overwhelming support,&quot; said executive director Devon Page. The inquiry was one plank in a &quot;fight-back&quot; strategy touted by the United Conservatives on the 2019 election campaign trail. Forensic accountant Steve Allan was tapped that summer to be commissioner with an initial $2.5-million budget and July 2020 deadline. Allan&#x27;s report is expected on May 31 after three extensions and a $1-million budget increase. Page called the inquiry a &quot;political stunt that&#x27;s not based in reality&quot; and wants it shut down. --- What we are watching in the U.S. ... Former President Donald Trump fumed that his attorneys’ performance on the opening day of his second impeachment trial was a disaster, as allies and Republican senators questioned the strategy and some called for yet another shakeup to his legal team. Trump, who was watching the proceedings in Washington from his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, was furious at what he saw, according to a person familiar with his thinking. Senators, too, criticized what they described as an unfocused and rambling performance as Trump&#x27;s team and Democratic House managers began to lay out their cases in front of the Senate jury. While it remains unlikely that more than a handful of Republicans will join Democrats in convicting the former president at the end of the trial, the proceedings were a chance for Trump to try to repair some of the damage to his legacy incurred over the storming of the Capitol by a mob of his supporters. Trump has been charged with inciting the Jan. 6 insurrection, and last month he became the first president in history to be impeached by the House twice. But Trump&#x27;s team — which was announced little more than a week ago — appeared unprepared as they attempted a good cop, bad cop routine that veered from flattery to legalese, and stood in dramatic contrast to Democrats&#x27; focused emotional appeals. Trump — ever the showman — was impressed with the Democrats, who opened Tuesday&#x27;s session with powerful video that compiled scenes of the deadly attack on Congress. And he complained that his team — especially lead lawyer Bruce Castor — came off badly on television and looked weak in comparison, according to the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations. The anger was echoed by Trump allies, who blasted the lawyers both publicly and privately and with repeated profanities. --- What we are watching in the rest of the world ... A spacecraft from the United Arab Emirates swung into orbit around Mars on Tuesday in a triumph for the Arab world’s first interplanetary mission. Ground controllers at the UAE’s space centre in Dubai rose to their feet and broke into applause when word came that the craft, called Amal, Arabic for Hope, had reached the end of its seven-month, 300-million-mile journey and had begun circling the red planet, where it will gather detailed data on Mars’ atmosphere. The orbiter fired its main engines for 27 minutes in an intricate, high-stakes manoeuver that slowed the craft enough for it to be captured by Mars’ gravity. It took a nail-biting 11 minutes for the signal confirming success to reach Earth. Tensions were high: Over the years, Mars has been the graveyard for a multitude of missions from various countries. A visibly relieved Omran Sharaf, the mission’s director, declared, “To the people of the UAE and Arab and Islamic nations, we announce the success of the UAE reaching Mars.” Two more unmanned spacecraft from the U.S. and China are following close behind, set to arrive at Mars over the next several days. All three missions were launched in July to take advantage of the close alignment of Earth and Mars. --- On this day in 1906 ... Prince Rupert was chosen from 15,000 entries as the name of the Grand Trunk Railway&#x27;s Pacific terminal. Eleanor Macdonald of Winnipeg won $250 for suggesting the name. --- In entertainment ... A brother of one of three women slain by their ex-partner in the Ottawa Valley has recruited Margaret Atwood for a music project about gender-based domestic violence. An awareness campaign by baritone Joshua Hopkins, whose sister Nathalie Warmerdam was murdered in 2015, caught the attention of Atwood and Florida-raised composer Jake Heggie. They agreed to join him in an effort to &quot;inspire other voices&quot; to the cause with an eight-track album of Atwood&#x27;s poetry sung by Hopkins and with Heggie on piano. &quot;Songs for Murdered Sisters&quot; was co-commissioned by the Houston Grand Opera and the National Arts Centre Orchestra in Ottawa. The album will be released on March 5, shortly before International Women&#x27;s Day. &quot;Songs for Murdered Sisters&quot; was inspired by the murders perpetrated by Basil Borutski, who was convicted in 2017 of first-degree murder in the deaths of Hopkins&#x27; sister, 48-year-old Warmerdam, and 36-year-old Anastasia Kuzyk. Borutski also was convicted of second-degree murder in the slaying of 66-year-old Carol Culleton. All three murders happened within an hour of each other on Sept. 22, 2015. Borutski had relationships with all three women and sought revenge for their supposed grievances against him, the court was told in his trial. --- ICYMI ... A program to cull invasive, non-migratory Canada geese in British Columbia&#x27;s North Okanagan has the strong support of Vernon city council. Councillors have voted 6-1 in favour of the program to spend up to $40,000 to eliminate as many as 250 geese. Initial plans would see about 10 kayakers rounding up the geese at three Vernon-area beaches on Okanagan Lake, something Cumming says would have to be done annually, to keep numbers in check. Staff say a longer-term plan will be created and council was encouraged to maintain other options, including an egg addling program which destroys the embryo of fertilized eggs but leaves the eggs in the nest so geese do not lay more. Word of the cull has already prompted two separate petitions signed by nearly 2,000 opponents of the plan. In addition to addling, council has been told alternatives to a full-scale cull could include sport hunting and kill-to-scare, a process that removes a single animal from the flock, generally encouraging the birds to move to another location for a period of time. --- This report by The Canadian Press was first published Feb. 10, 2021 The Canadian Press</p></div></div></div></li><li class="js-stream-content Pos(r)" data-reactid="356"><div class="Py(14px) Pos(r)" data-test-locator="mega" data-reactid="357"><div class="Cf" data-reactid="358"><div class="Fl(start) Pos(r) Mt(2px) W(26.5%) Maw(220px)" data-reactid="359"><div class="W(100%) H(100%) detachable" data-reactid="360"></div></div><div class="Ov(h) Pend(44px) Pstart(25px) Pos(r)" data-reactid="361"><div class="Fz(12px) Fw(b) Tt(c) D(ib) Mb(6px) C($c-fuji-blue-1-a) Mend(9px) Mt(-2px)" data-test-locator="catlabel" data-reactid="362">News</div><div class="C(#959595) Fz(11px) D(ib) Mb(6px)" data-reactid="363">Global News</div><h3 class="Mb(5px)" data-reactid="364"><a class="js-content-viewer wafer-caas Fw(b) Fz(20px) Lh(23px) Fz(17px)--sm1024 Lh(19px)--sm1024 mega-item-header-link Td(n) C(#0078ff):h C(#000) LineClamp(2,46px) LineClamp(2,38px)--sm1024 not-isInStreamVideoEnabled" href="/coronavirus-majority-canadians-governments-acted-090044682.html" data-uuid="103076e3-b76b-3af6-aba9-197af9c3e797" data-wf-caas-uuid="103076e3-b76b-3af6-aba9-197af9c3e797" data-wf-caas-prefetch="1" data-reactid="365"><u class="StretchedBox" data-reactid="366"></u><!-- react-text: 367 -->Coronavirus: Majority of Canadians say governments should have acted faster amid COVID-19, Ipsos poll shows<!-- /react-text --></a></h3><p class="Fz(14px) Lh(19px) Fz(13px)--sm1024 Lh(17px)--sm1024 LineClamp(2,38px) LineClamp(2,34px)--sm1024 M(0)" data-reactid="368">A majority of Canadians believe that governments at multiple levels should have acted sooner to reduce the number of coronavirus cases in the country, according to new polling from Ipsos.

The reefs below the waves are beautiful beyond description and the ocean life is fascinating. Each dive is different and there is more to learn than anyone could ever manage. This scuba diver has explored the waters in Belize, Mexico, Cayman Islands, Cuba, Galapagos Islands and Papua New Guinea. He has seen bizarre and wondrous creatures, but he has just found something unlike any other living organism that he has ever seen. Initially drawn to a shiny sphere nestled in the coral and sponges in Kimbe Bay, Papua New Guinea, this diver believed he was about to pick up a piece of glass or other litter that had been dropped overboard. As he drifted closer, it looked like it could even be a metallic ball. It was completely spherical and uniform in shape, roughly the size of a large chicken egg. Although experienced scuba divers are well acquainted with the rule not to touch the reefs or sea life, the one exception is that removing litter from the ocean is advisable in most cases. This diver drew closer and he was able to see the shine from his dive lights penetrating the outer surface, reflecting back at him from surfaces within the sphere. With a little imagination, he could now picture it as some alien object or well polished meteorite. As he reached for the strange object, he found the outside slightly springy. It was not metal or glass and he realized that felt like a peeled grape or even a huge eyeball. It was anchored to the coral and removing it would disturb the life around it. Reluctant to touch it further, he left it where it was and brought his video footage back to the dive ship. A dive instructor and photography expert on board explained that this was actually a species of algae and that it grew so large that it is believed to be the largest single celled organism on the planet. Aptly named &quot;bubble algae&quot; or &#x27;sailor&#x27;s eyeball&quot;, they occupy most oceans throughout the world. Scientists are keen to use these algae in research because they make it easy to study the migration of water soluble compounds across biological membranes. The ocean is full of fascinating and wonderous creatures. We are only beginning to understand our environment and the life forms that share our planet.</p></div></div></div></li></ul></div></div></div><script>if (window.performance) {window.performance.mark

And it had nothing to do with promoting another goofball buddy flick. It was a Super Bowl commercial launched by General Motors as the largest U.S. automaker marked its newfound ambitions as an electric-carmaker. Less than two weeks ago, GM caught some people by surprise with its pledge to make the vast majority of the vehicles it produces electric by 2035. Amid growing calls for action on climate change, some argue it has the potential to be transformative. And for the North American energy sector, particularly oil and gasoline producers, understanding the implications of the electric vehicle (EV) push just became that much more urgent. Long-term implications Warren Mabee, director of Queen's University's Institute for Energy and Environmental Policy, believes for the oilpatch, the significance of GM's announcement outweighs the recent cancellation of Keystone XL. \"That really starts to eat away at the demand side of the equation as consumers have more and more electric vehicles available to them,\" Mabee said. \"And as the costs sort of come in line with what [consumers are] expecting to pay, I think we're going to see fewer and fewer people opting for gasoline-powered vehicles. \"That really has long-term implications for the industry.\" But he sees opportunities, too, whether they are in batteries or hydrogen. \"Let's try to beat some others to the punch because I think there's some real potential.\" Some market observers have called GM's target date \"aggressive.\" The complexity of the task is substantial and the pledge, as critics have pointed out, is aspirational. Significant EV growth will also require a backbone of infrastructure such as recharging stations. Supply chains will need to be established to support key components such as batteries and power systems. Also key to the effort, if the goal is to slash carbon emissions, is ensuring there is the necessary infrastructure capable of providing renewable energy for plug-in vehicles. Jody Freeman, a counselor for energy and climate change in the Obama White House in 2009 and 2010, wrote earlier this month in the New York Times: \"Shifting from gasoline to electricity helps to decarbonize transportation only if the electrons fuelling cars and trucks are relatively 'green.'\" An industry-wide sea change General Motors' plans will see it invest $27 billion US in electric and autonomous vehicles in the next five years. \"There can be no doubt the future of transportation, starting now, is electric,\" said Fred Krupp, head of the Environmental Defence Fund, which is working with GM on the strategy. And GM is not alone. Last week, Ford Motor Co. said it would spend at least $22 billion US developing EVs from 2016 through 2025, nearly double what it previously announced. Among others, Volkswagen is spending billions of dollars in its pursuit of all-electric Tesla. And, last fall, California's Governor Gavin Newson inked an executive order stating all new passenger cars and trucks sold in the state would have to be emission-free by 2035. Will drivers come for the ride? Of course, GM promising to go electric doesn't guarantee success. There's a lot of work ahead. But Mabee believes GM can reach its goal, suggesting big manufacturers have the kind of heft needed to make technological improvements in key areas such as battery life and efficiency. Consumers will have to come along for the ride, too. While GM sold more than 2.5 million vehicles in the U.S. last year, only about 20,000 were electric vehicles, according to Reuters. Analysts at Rystad Energy said that as battery costs decline, vehicle performance increases and charging infrastructure improves, electric mobility will eventually out-compete its internal combustion engine counterparts. To that end, EV technology is advancing rapidly. However, Brian Kingston, president of the Canadian Vehicle Manufacturers' Association, said this week in the National Observer, \"price parity with gas-powered vehicles remains years off.\" Others believe that day could come in the next couple of years. That's why some proponents argue rebates and government incentives are so important to grow the market. The entry-level price of a new Chevrolet Bolt EV hatchback, for example, is more than $45,000 in Canada. Still, a recent report from Deloitte found U.S. consumers' biggest concern regarding all-electric vehicles was range and a lack of charging infrastructure, not the price of the vehicle. And, in Canada, some argue one of the challenges facing would-be buyers is the ability to find one at the dealership. Still lots of road ahead For proponents of EVs, automakers' big investments in the sector provide reason for optimism, but there's still a lot of ground to make up. Dennis DesRosiers, an analyst with DesRosiers Automotive Consultants, noted North America has had electrified vehicles for years now, but they still only make up a small percentage of the overall market. Last summer, the Paris-based International Energy Agency estimated that electric car sales will account for about three per cent of global car sales in 2020. In the first and second quarters of 2020, 3.5 per cent of total new vehicles registered in Canada were zero-emission vehicles, according to Statistics Canada, a category that includes battery-electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids. \"At some point in this century — not this decade, this century — all vehicle companies will have 100 per cent electric vehicles for sale,\" said DesRosiers, who is based in Richmond Hill, about 35 km north of Toronto. \"That being said, the GM announcement is aggressive in terms of time frame.\" The long life of gas-powered cars Transformation to electric vehicles would mean a slowing demand for gasoline, DesRosiers said, but not overnight. New cars entering the market today will have a long road life and the vast majority of those vehicles run on gasoline or diesel, he said. Improved fuel efficiency means new gasoline-powered vehicles will require less fuel than in the past, DeRosiers said, but \"the oilpatch has got quite a long road in front of it still.\" \"At some point, energy demand related to carbon-based fuels is going to collapse.\" \"But I think it's probably a good 20 to 30 years out, possibly even more.\" Richard Masson, an executive fellow at the University of Calgary's School of Public Policy, said the oilpatch has to pay attention but doesn't expect a precipitous drop in demand for Alberta crude. Looking out over the next two decades, Masson said oil markets will need more crude to replace anticipated production declines elsewhere. \"Alberta is very secure, stable, connected to a big market,\" said Masson, former head of the Alberta Petroleum Marketing Commission. \"We can easily be a good part of that energy mix going forward.\" Energy transition 'on its way' But if fuel and oil demand is squeezed, the big challenge for Canadian oilsands producers may be to be cost-competitive in a global market while also facing environmental scrutiny from investors. \"If I'm looking at the global demand picture, it means that the competition became that much tighter,\" said Al Salazar, vice-president of intelligence at Enverus, an energy data analytics firm.","is_eligible":true,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fca.news.yahoo.com\u002Fgms-electric-vehicle-plan-could-090000574.html","property":"Business","categoryLabel":"Business","title":"Why GM's switch to electric vehicles may be more important for the oilpatch than Keystone XL's cancellation","images":{"img:220x123":{"height":123,"width":220,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fs.yimg.com\u002Fuu\u002Fapi\u002Fres\u002F1.2\u002FGQJ6a.2FKydoOlJjIJbmTA--~B\u002FZmk9c3RyaW07aD0xMjM7cT04MDt3PTIyMDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fs.yimg.com\u002Fuu\u002Fapi\u002Fres\u002F1.2\u002FN.b0Ub1kEBowHziDc5WobA--~B\u002FaD0zOTk7dz02MjA7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fmedia.zenfs.com\u002Fen\u002Fcbc.ca\u002Fb90e7484ca5fc563def1fd0ddd93bd70.cf.jpg"},"img:440x246":{"height":246,"width":440,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fs.yimg.com\u002Fuu\u002Fapi\u002Fres\u002F1.2\u002FVIELdyhjKNDiUr9NwH.Xpg--~B\u002FZmk9c3RyaW07aD0yNDY7cT04MDt3PTQ0MDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fs.yimg.com\u002Fuu\u002Fapi\u002Fres\u002F1.2\u002FN.b0Ub1kEBowHziDc5WobA--~B\u002FaD0zOTk7dz02MjA7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fmedia.zenfs.com\u002Fen\u002Fcbc.ca\u002Fb90e7484ca5fc563def1fd0ddd93bd70.cf.jpg"}},"type":"article","finance":{"stockTickers":null},"link":"\u002Fgms-electric-vehicle-plan-could-090000574.html","id":"d7c076a1-e037-3372-b6aa-09d4d0df0894","publisher":"CBC","comments_allowed":"false","publisher_id":"cbc.ca","off_network":false},{"i13n":{"bpos":1,"cpos":3,"cposy":8},"summary":"The latest numbers of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Canada as of 4 a.m. ET on Wednesday, Feb. 10, 2021.

Flair, which bills itself as Canada's only independent low-fare airline, announced flights will begin May 1 in Halifax and Saint John, and in Charlottetown on June 4. The airline will add the following Maritime routes: Service to Toronto, Ottawa and Waterloo out of Halifax. Service to Toronto from Charlottetown and Saint John. Flair had originally intended to expand into the Maritimes in 2020, but put those plans on hold because of the pandemic.The Maritime flights are part of a broader expansion that includes eight new Canadian destinations. According to the Flair website, a return flight from Charlottetown to Toronto, including taxes and fees, will cost $98.27. Flair president and CEO Stephen Jones said Flair continues to support the restrictions on non-essential travel, but he believes travel restrictions will have eased enough by this summer for the airline to get a full domestic network flying. Jones acknowledged there is still uncertainty. \"No one's got a crystal ball, but we just have to make our plans based on the best evidence that we have,\" he said. \"If we don't decide now and we don't move now it'll be too late for the summer, because we need to allow some time for people to book flights. So we're planning now, we're going on sale now, and we're hoping that people will start to plan their summers now with a degree of confidence and positivity as well.\" The airline is providing COVID coverage that will allow people to get refunds or change flights. With the new destinations, Flair will serve 18 cities in Canada.

Phase two of the plan is slated to begin in April. It will focus on the general population in 10-year increments, starting with people in their 60s. The second phase is also set to include vaccinations for those in emergency shelters and those living and working in group homes for people with intellectual disabilities. \"And as I understand, the objective is to get as many people immunized as quickly as possible,\" said Dr. Dennis Kendel, a retired physician and health policy consultant. \"I think the decision to actually proceed in progressive age cohorts probably is the best decision, because when you're trying to mobilize something as massive as this, trying to focus on special interest groups and special needs populations has much potential to actually slow things down.\" The province says that once Phase 2 is underway, vaccinations will be available through mass immunization clinics, walk-in and drive-thru clinics, public health clinics and community-based options such as pharmacies. Kendel says this diversity of immunization venues has the potential to work well. \"At the peak of the distribution process, there would be 2,200 people involved in the vaccination process. So that would be people booking the appointments and facilitating moving through clinics and those actually giving the shots,\" Kendel said. According to the province, some of this staff would be drawn from the existing Saskatchewan Health Authority workforce, including non-clinical staff. The SHA intends to reach out to medical students and retired health professionals as well. \"I do think that a lot of people are quite willing to step forward and help out, even though they may have been retired for a short while. They haven't lost their skills and hopefully they can be part of the the group that gets this done,\" Kendel said. \"This is all predicated on an assumption of reasonably predictable supply and there have been problems which have been universal across Canada. So we aren't unique in that regard.\" The province says the commencement of mass vaccinations will depend on the number and consistency of vaccine deliveries from the federal government. Supply has been recently delayed. But the provincial government says it is hopeful that mass vaccinations can start as soon as April, based on the current federal vaccine delivery schedule. \"Some of the problems that caused delay earlier are now resolved. The Pfizer plant shutdown is coming to an end, so Pfizer will actually be producing more than they did previously,\" Kendel said. \"If something does interrupt supply, then we have to make adjustments and accommodate that. Getting angry at another level of government or getting angry at the supplier doesn't help. We have to deal with it as it comes.\" Vaccine rollout so far Dr. Cory Neudorf, public health physician and community health and epidemiology professor at the University of Saskatchewan, calls the distribution plan \"clear and transparent.\" \"I think the age-based approach ... really fits with their goal of wanting to protect the most vulnerable and those at highest risk and sort of preventing that serious illness and death that's going to end up causing the most serious impact on people of Saskatchewan and also on the health-care system,\" Neudorf said. He says that Saskatchewan's vaccine rollout has been good so far. \"I think the ability to try to maximize the number of doses, including recognizing that there was a little more vaccine in each vial than the five doses required has allowed us to actually get more doses out than we were told were shipped to us,\" Neudorf said. \"The speed at which they rolled that out in the first few weeks of January ... we really caught up. And it was it was quite impressive.\" But Neudorf said he would like to hear from the province about the vaccination plan for those individuals that are living with front-line workers or those that work with the vulnerable populations addressed in Phase 2 of the plan.

Regina is experiencing a burgeoning wave of experimental and urban musicians, and a rise in visual storytellers, with a plethora of young Black talent leading the way. Many of these creators are forging a new path in their field without much of a blueprint to follow, as few Black people have occupied these spaces in Saskatchewan's capital city before. Take 27-year-old Janielle Ogilvie, a Black female graphic designer who isn't sure if she's ever \"seen anybody else like me\" in her field here. Ogilvie has made her identity as a Black creative an integral element of her work. \"Personally, I would like to identify as a Black creator,\" Ogilvie said. \"A lot of people reach out to me because they want to see a diverse vision. They want to work with someone who has experienced certain things, and that's where I come in with my experience as a Black person.\" Not only is this reflected in the type of art Ogilvie creates, but also in the purpose for which she creates it. \"I'm doing a lot of things for the Black community. I get a lot of people reaching out to me in regards to making something for causes like Black Lives Matter,\" she said. Ogilvie also joined the board of directors at CJTR, the local community radio station, in September 2019. This brought a number of job opportunities her way. \"I've been able to collaborate with a lot of other artists that way, meet new people, and managed to get a full-time job doing graphic designing as well,\" she said. With her passions for music, art and her community, Ogilvie hopes to do more work focused in these areas moving forward. 'I am Black first before I am an artist' Like Ogilvie, 23-year-old hip-hop artist Oboise identifies as a Black creator. \"I am Black first before I am an artist. My experiences inspire what I put into my music,\" he said. His song \"Listen Up\" arguably reveals the most about the musician's life as a Black man. \"I wrote that song to touch on life in general and after many instances of seeing what people from the Black community are forced to deal with,\" Oboise said. \"After having racial slurs thrown at me and seeing people being killed for their skin colour, I couldn't sit by and not speak on it.\" Oboise moved to Regina from Calgary five years ago, and it's then that he started making music. At the time, he didn't know many people in the biz and set about making his own mark. \"I believe I'm one of the few artists who is incredibly versatile and I do it well,\" Oboise said. \"When I create, it stems from weeks or months of studying certain genres and artists. I don't seek to make music that is trending or to pose as someone I'm not.\" The rapper has been consistent and relentless in his pursuit of a music career. He has released six major singles, five EPs, and two full-length albums in the span of four years. Oboise also quickly became the go-to rapper for collaborations in Regina. Last year alone, he was featured on three major records from the city's contemporary music scene: Up and Away by Rooky, Slippin' by TOVA, and Online by D4WN. Oboise has tackled a variety of genres over the years. His most recent E.P., \"Feels Like A Sunday,\" finds the rapper tackling gospel rap and sharing a vulnerable side of his artistry. He said he consciously worked with another Black artist on the track because he knew he \"needed someone with a soulful voice and seeing as soul music originated in the African American community, I knew I needed a strong powerful Black voice.\" But Oboise said he does not exclusively collaborate with Black musicians. \"I work with artists based on their skill and what they bring to the table.\" With over 150,000 streams and 31,000 views on YouTube, Oboise still believes that his greatest accomplishment as a musician is being able to create art that people can relate to. \"When people tell you that your music has inspired them to start their own music and create a better relationship with their parents — that means a lot more than exposure can mean.\" For more stories about the experiences of Black Canadians — from anti-Black racism to success stories within the Black community — check out Being Black in Canada, a CBC project Black Canadians can be proud of.

After this newspaper and other media outlets had reported on the unsuccessful FOIPOP (Freedom of Information) request made by the Nova Scotia Progressive Conservative Education Critic Tim Halman asking for air quality reports from the province’s schools, the quiet release of these documents was perplexing. The Journal contacted Halman for his reaction to the reports and made inquiries regarding the report to the Department of Education and Early Childhood Development and the Strait Regional Centre for Education (SRCE). Halman told The Journal last week (Feb. 5), “In the last few days there have been many government announcements ... we know the government doesn’t have a problem giving notices and announcements. The last couple of days has clearly demonstrated that. Why didn’t they do an announcement on this? Why is this information posted and no advertisement or notice given to the public? “I have four kids. I send my kids to school. I don’t believe there is a safety issue, but I believe there is a lack of accountably and transparency issue,” said Halman, who was a teacher for 15 years before entering politics. In addition to the quiet rollout, the summary reports offer very little information about the state of ventilation in schools and no information detailing the expenditure of the $2.7 million earmarked for ventilation maintenance and cleaning from the Federal Funding Safe Return to Class monies. The summary reports consist of a chart listing each school in the regional centre for education and a brief response to each of the following categories: System Type (Active or Passive), Inspection completed by Sept 8, 2020 (Yes or No), Maintenance Complete? (Yes \u002F No \u002F N\u002FA), System Operating as Intended? (Yes or No). Halman said of the report, “The information that’s been provided, it’s very surface level; there’s nothing in depth. You look at the quality of the data that’s been provided – you can raise a lot of questions about that.” Halman likens the difficulty in gaining access to information on ventilation to that of the process in gaining access to reports on lead in school water supplies, information released in Sept. 2020; and air quality problems at Ian Forsyth Elementary School in Dartmouth, in Halman’s riding, which resulted in parents pulling students out of the school in March of 2018. The Journal asked the Department of Education and Early Childhood Development via email why there was no publicity surrounding the release of the summary reports, how and where the full reports could be accessed, and for an accounting of the federal monies spent on ventilation. The response to these questions, via email from Violet MacLeod, a communications advisor for the Department of Education and Early Childhood Development, did not answer any of these questions. The response stated, “Public Health has confirmed that there is no current test to directly check for COVID in the air … Public Health directed us to focus on ventilation. Ventilation system checks have been done at each and every school before students returned in the fall. Systems were checked, repaired as needed and confirmed to be in good working order; windows are able to open and systems are working as designed. The results of these checks are on the Regions\u002FCSAP’s websites. “Additionally, we’ve invested $2.7 million in funding to ensure checks happen through the school year and that needed repairs are made quickly with 24\u002Fhour on-call maintenance services. This is over and above annual maintenance,” wrote MacLeod. The Journal also asked the SRCE why it did not publicize the release of the ventilation reporting summary. In an email response Tuesday (Feb. 9), SRCE’s Coordinator of Communications Deanna Gillis stated, “The SRCE uses a number of communications platforms, including print, online and social media, to regularly share information with students, staff and families on a variety of education matters. They include the SRCE website (srce.ca), Twitter (@SRCE_NS), the monthly report of the Regional Executive Director, the Stay Informed notification system for class\u002Fbus announcements and news items, region-wide email alerts, and the srce@srce.ca general email is also widely shared for inquiries.” Information about the availability of the SRCE’s ventilation reporting summary was not in the most recent regional executive director’s report. It was not posted on SRCE twitter nor emailed to parents and guardians. It is available on the SRCE website: https:\u002F\u002Fsrce.ca\u002F.

This year, the planning, preparation and delivery has been altered by the pandemic, but COVID-19 has also made the need greater, as women and children are more likely to find themselves confined with abusive men. According to a national survey, gender-based violence during the height of the COVID-19 lockdown in Canada was more severe and more frequent. Manpreet Multani of the World Sikh Organization of Canada, one of the groups behind the initiative, said 1,100 care packages will go to women at 25 shelters in B.C. this year. She estimates that other groups across the country will bring the national total close to 3,000 packages. The initiative is called One Billion Rising — a name drawn from the statistic that one-third of the world's 3.5 billion women will experience physical or sexual assault in their lifetime, according to Multani. Typically the contents of the care packages would be collected through a donation drive and fundraising. This year, however, it was limited to a fundraising campaign and the items were then purchased. Previously, the packages are all assembled in a central location, but as a result of the pandemic, about 90 families picked up the supplies to put the care packages together at home. It differs from province to province, said Multani, but in B.C., the brown gift bags are filled with essential hygiene items, including toothpaste, toothbrushes, soap, shampoo and conditioner — all items suggested by the shelters. 'There are people out there rooting for them' The bags are adorned with kind notes, and school children make personal cards to put inside. \"The recipients can know that there are people out there rooting for them and wishing them the best in life,\" said Multani. The delivery of the care packages has also been modified to ensure they're COVID-safe. The volunteers won't have a face-to-face experience with the recipients, and delivery is being made a few days early so the packages can remain isolated before they're distributed to the women staying in shelters. This will be Multani's first year taking part in the effort. She said she wanted to get involved to help break the stigma and help women and children in tough situations. \"I'm a big advocate for women's rights, and in the Punjabi community, sometimes domestic violence can be a big issue and it's kept very hush-hush,\" she said.

In a collaborative effort between Temagami First Nation, Ontario Power Generation (OPG), Sault Ste. Marie Museum, and Woodland Heritage Northeast, the historical pictograph was repatriated to Bear Island just before Christmas 2020. Temagami First Nation’s director of lands and resources Robin Koistinen said she has known about the missing pictograph for 25 years and has tried to locate it numerous times. “We are very proud to have it back. Back on our land,” Koistinen said. “It really was a team effort.” It is a 300-pound, metre-wide rock slab depicting three figures. The slab had fallen off the main rock face and was found lying face down at Matabichuan River by archaeologist Thor Conway in the '70s. At the time, there were concerns that flooding and fluctuating water levels, caused by development on the river, could damage the rock and the paint. According to Conway’s notes, the slab was taken to the regional archaeologist’s office in Sault Ste. Marie in 1977 for temporary study. The plans were then to return the slab to Temagami for public display. “It is a preferred heritage policy only to remove rock art from its original setting under exceptional circumstances since paintings are so vitally tied by traditional beliefs to their local environment,” Conway wrote in 1980. However, the rock went missing and its location was unknown until last year. In the summer of 2020, OPG’s senior environment advisor Gillian MacLeod called Koistinen asking Temagami to participate in some archaeological assessment work at the Matabichuan River. Koistinen agreed to send two field technicians Victoria Winsor and elder Mike Paul to the site, but there was a catch. \"When Gillian wanted to the work this summer, I said as part of the work and us assisting them, I wanted the pictograph located and returned to us,\" she said. Working on the summer project were also Ryan Primrose, an archaeologist from the Woodland Heritage Northeast, and OPG’s Indigenous Relations Officer Sue Prince. “Nobody knew where it was. And then, all of the sudden, somebody had a cue to call Sault Ste. Marie and, sure enough, there our pictograph was,” Koistinen said. “We’re very pleased to have it back within our nation.” Just before Christmas, Winsor and a Temagami community member Mike Polson travelled to Sault Ste. Marie Museum to pick up the artifact. On the way back, their vehicle had to be barged across the lake to Bear Island to avoid damaging the artifact. The pictograph is now displayed at the newly-built 16,000 square-foot Lakeview Gathering Place on Bear Island, where community members will be able to see the slab once the pandemic restrictions are lifted. OPG helped with the efforts, including retrieving and protecting the pictograph while it was moved around, making sure that the display cabinet was suitable for its weight, and installing a plaque and descriptive display materials, according to Winsor. “The process of finding this artifact was a fantastic collaborative effort,” Winsor said in a statement. “The museum’s curator has been enthusiastically assisting us, and the museum’s board have voted unanimously to repatriate the artifact … It is my hope that the return of an artifact represents a change in how archaeology and repatriation is conducted.” This is the first repatriated artifact that is going to stay in the community. Previously, different artifacts were lent by museums to Temagami for educational purposes. “But knowing how unique and special they are, we returned them because some of those facilities can take better care of some of those items because we don’t have the proper means to keep them in good condition,” Koistinen said. “But it is our desire to repatriate our goods, our history, our implements, our artifacts.” The pictograph isn’t something that can deteriorate like other artifacts, Koistinen said, and being in a display case in an air-controlled environment, as opposed to being exposed to natural elements, it should be “fine where it is,\" she said. “We want to provide more context around it and label it more properly, so the history is with it there too, so people can understand it,” she said. “There’s a little more work to do to really, really make it display-worthy.” Dariya Baiguzhiyeva, Local Journalism Initiative Reporter, TimminsToday.com","is_eligible":true,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fca.news.yahoo.com\u002Fmissing-artifact-returns-temagami-115513366.html","property":"News","categoryLabel":"News","title":"Missing artifact returns to Temagami","type":"article","finance":{"stockTickers":null},"link":"\u002Fmissing-artifact-returns-temagami-115513366.html","id":"9d23205a-6451-3161-a98b-bf26e5c79c7f","publisher":"Local Journalism Initiative","comments_allowed":"false","publisher_id":"local_journalism_initiative_huffpo_763","off_network":false},{"i13n":{"bpos":1,"cpos":11,"cposy":16},"summary":"Recent developments: What's the latest? Ottawa Public Health (OPH) is reporting 26 new cases of COVID-19 and one more death Wednesday. There are only 19 residents in hospital for COVID-19 treatment, the lowest that number has been in more than a month. Quebec school administrators say report cards show many students are struggling, leading to calls for the Quebec government to lower the bar for CEGEP admissions. An Ottawa retirement home manager has been suspended after accusations he allowed his wife to receive a dose of the COVID-19 vaccine intended for a front-line worker. How many cases are there? As of Wednesday, 13,759 Ottawa residents have tested positive for COVID-19. There are 402 known active cases, 12,929 resolved cases and 428 deaths from COVID-19. Public health officials have reported more than 24,500 COVID-19 cases across eastern Ontario and western Quebec, including more than 23,100 resolved cases. Elsewhere in eastern Ontario, 125 people have died of COVID-19, and 156 people have died in western Quebec. CBC Ottawa is profiling those who've died of COVID-19. If you'd like to share your loved one's story, please get in touch. What can I do? The Ontario stay-at-home order remains for the three local areas that have not moved back to the five-colour scale: the Eastern Ontario Health Unit, Leeds, Grenville and Lanark District Health Unit and Ottawa Public Health. People there must only leave home when it's essential. People who leave home for non-essential reasons can be fined. WATCH | Lowertown residents concerned over lack of notice about isolation centre: Travel between regions and provinces is not recommended. Private indoor gatherings are not allowed, while outdoor gatherings are capped at five people. It's strongly recommended people stick to their own households and socializing is not considered essential. People who live alone are allowed close contact with one other household. Most outdoor recreation venues remain open with restrictions, including the full Rideau Canal Skateway. Students across eastern Ontario can return to the classroom. The rules change as regions move back to the scale. WATCH | Ontario's new ski hill rules: Hastings Prince Edward Public Health, Kingston, Frontenac and Lennox & Addington Public Health and the Renfrew County and District Health Unit are moving back into green today, the lowest level on the scale. It's expected the rest of eastern Ontario will shed the stay-at-home order Tuesday. Their colours have not been announced. Western Quebec residents are also being asked to stay home unless it's essential to leave and not see anyone they don't live with. An exception for people living alone allows them to exclusively visit one other home. Non-essential businesses, hair salons and museums are now allowed to open across Quebec. Locally, gyms and restaurants will stay closed. Students are back in classrooms, including post-secondary ones. Like in Ontario, travel from one region of Quebec to another is discouraged. Quebec's 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew remains in place, and people could face fines of up to $6,000 for breaking the rules. It no longer applies to people experiencing homelessness. Distancing and isolating The novel coronavirus primarily spreads through droplets when an infected person speaks, coughs, sneezes, or breathes onto someone or something. These droplets can hang in the air. People can be contagious without symptoms, even after getting a vaccine. New coronavirus variants can be more contagious. This means it is important to take precautions now and in the months to come like staying home while symptomatic, keeping hands and frequently touched surfaces clean and maintaining distance from anyone you don't live with — even with a mask on. Masks, preferably ones that fit snugly and have three layers, are mandatory in indoor public settings in Ontario and Quebec. OPH says residents should also wear masks outside their homes whenever possible. Anyone with COVID-19 symptoms should self-isolate, as should those who've been ordered to do so by their public health unit. The length varies in Ontario and Quebec. Health Canada recommends older adults and people with underlying medical conditions and\u002For weakened immune systems stay home as much as possible and get friends and family to help with errands. The federal government is in the midst of tightening international travel rules and asks people not to vacation abroad. As of Monday, people will have to show proof of a recent negative COVID-19 test to enter Canada by land without a fine. Symptoms and vaccines COVID-19 can range from a cold-like illness to a severe lung infection, with common symptoms including fever, a cough, vomiting and loss of taste or smell. Children can develop a rash. If you have severe symptoms, call 911. Mental health can also be affected by the pandemic, and resources are available to help. COVID-19 vaccines have been given to local health-care workers and long-term care residents. About 49,500 doses have been given out, including about 34,700 doses in Ottawa and 8,800 in western Quebec Pfizer temporarily slowing its vaccine production to expand its factory means some jurisdictions can't guarantee people will get the necessary second dose three weeks after the first. It may take four to six weeks. There is some uncertainty about the Moderna vaccine supply. Ontario's first doses are going to care home residents. Ottawa has given a second dose to all but a few long-term care residents, is giving second doses to some health-care workers and by the end of the day, will have given a first dose to high-risk retirement home residents. That province's campaign is still expected to expand to priority groups such as older adults and essential workers in March or April, with vaccines widely available in August. Ottawa believes it can have nearly 700,000 residents vaccinated by then, hitting a groove of nearly 11,000 doses a day by early summer. Quebec is also giving a single dose to as many people as possible, starting with people in care homes and health-care workers, then remote communities, then older adults and essential workers and finally the general public. It has had to delay vaccinating people in private seniors' homes. Quebecers should get their second dose within 90 days. Where to get tested In eastern Ontario: Anyone seeking a test should book an appointment. Ontario recommends only getting tested if you have symptoms, if you've been told to by your health unit or the province, or if you fit certain other criteria. The KFL&A health unit says people that have left southeastern Ontario or been in contact with someone who has should get a test as they track a coronavirus variant. People without symptoms but who are part of the province's targeted testing strategy can make an appointment at select pharmacies. Travellers who need a test have very few local options to pay for one. Ottawa has nine permanent test sites, with mobile sites wherever demand is particularly high. People can arrange a test in Picton over the phone or Bancroft, Belleville and Trenton, where online booking is preferred. The Leeds, Grenville and Lanark health unit has permanent sites in Almonte, Brockville, Kemptville and Smiths Falls and a mobile clinic. Renfrew County test clinic locations are posted weekly. Residents can also call their family doctor or 1-844-727-6404 with health questions. Kingston's main test site is at the Beechgrove Complex, another is in Napanee. The Eastern Ontario Health Unit has sites in Alexandria, Casselman, Cornwall, Hawkesbury, Rockland and Winchester. In western Quebec: Tests are strongly recommended for people with symptoms and their contacts. Outaouais residents can make an appointment in Gatineau at 135 blvd. Saint-Raymond or 617 ave. Buckingham. They can check the wait time for the Saint-Raymond site. There are recurring clinics by appointment in communities such as Maniwaki, Fort-Coulonge and Petite-Nation. Call 1-877-644-4545 with questions, including if walk-in testing is available nearby. First Nations, Inuit and Métis: Akwesasne has had nearly 170 residents test positive on the Canadian side of the border and six deaths. More than 330 people have tested positive across the community and eight have died. Its curfew from 11 p.m. to 5 a.m. is back and it has a COVID-19 test site by appointment only. Anyone returning to the community on the Canadian side of the international border who's been farther than 160 kilometres away — or visited Montreal — for non-essential reasons is asked to self-isolate for 14 days. It has released its vaccine plans. Kitigan Zibi has had 20 confirmed cases and Tyendinaga Mohawk Territory has had two, one of them active.. People in Pikwakanagan, which hasn't yet had a confirmed case, can book a COVID-19 test by calling 613-625-2259. Anyone in Tyendinaga who's interested in a test can call 613-967-3603. Inuit in Ottawa can call the Akausivik Inuit Family Health Team at 613-740-0999 for service, including testing, in Inuktitut or English on weekdays.

The territory, through a third-party review panel, will be reviewing all its procurement policies for the first time in a decade to identify what works, what doesn't and gather some innovative ideas on how to fix them. The review is also one way the territory is also looking to speed up economic recovery as the COVID-19 pandemic stretches on. Procurement is the process used by the N.W.T. government to buy and contract goods and services. Since January, the third-party review panel has been conducting online consultation sessions on the policy, with the goal of having a list of recommendations in place sometime this summer. As part of that review, the third party panel will be reviewing its Business Incentive Policy, or BIP. The policy gives businesses based in the N.W.T. or who use local employees an advantage in the bidding process, by automatically knocking as much as 20 per cent off their bid on tenders under one million dollars. On contracts over a million dollars, the BIP reduction shrinks to just two per cent for N.W.T.-based businesses with local workers. Jack Rowe, a principal with Rowe's Construction, said the decreased benefit on multi-million dollar projects gives southern companies \"no incentive\" to hire northern workers on multi-million dollar projects. If southern companies spend their first million dollars on northern materials, Rowe said, there is not much benefit to hiring from the North — or even keep spending on northern materials. \"You've lost any incentive to hire local people or buy local goods,\" Rowe said. The territory notes in its procurement discussion paper that it's also \"not always clear\" which businesses qualify for that reduction. Renee Comeau, executive director of the N.W.T. Chamber of Commerce, said the government should be reviewing which companies are paying payroll taxes and WSCC fees — proof that these companies have employees in the territory. \"We've seen a few instances where a company has been [given the reduction] and … they were just a remote office,\" Comeau said. \"If they don't have an N.W.T. payroll tax, it's pretty clear they don't have employees here. \"This is easy information for the government to look into.\" Indigenous procurement 'makes sense' The territory's discussion paper \"strongly suggests\" the creation of an Indigenous procurement strategy. Ernest Betsina, N'Dilo chief of the Yellowknives Dene First Nation, says that \"simply makes sense\" for the territory. \"We are in the majority, so I'm hoping the N.W.T. will listen to Indigenous groups,\" he said. Last July, the Yellowknives Dene First Nation retracted their support from the Slave Geological Project, a 413-kilometre gravel road between the eastern N.W.T. and western Nunavut, due to issues over procurement. By October, the N.W.T. and the First Nation reached an agreement, although no formal work plan was developed. Paul Gruner, CEO of the Det'on Cho Corporation, said the government needs to treat First Nations as equal partners earlier on in the development of major projects. \"We're not going to move forward … with advancing key infrastructure projects of that size if we don't have good, meaningful dialogue,\" Gruner said, noting the change in government also slowed down the consultation process. There's also room for an N.W.T. Indigenous procurement strategy that drives local employment by supporting the creation of small businesses, Betsina said. \"We're hoping that the money that comes to the community, stays in the community,\" Betsina said. Consider what works for Tłı̨chǫ, Yukon in review Comeau said another way to form the N.W.T.'s procurement strategy is to look elsewhere to see what's working. One example is a recent agreement between the Tłı̨chǫ and the N.W.T., which guarantees that 25 per cent of all the labour needed on a local project will be given to the Tłı̨chǫ Investment Corporation and RTL Construction Ltd. The territory also agreed to negotiate directly with the Tłı̨chǫ Government on other infrastructure projects. Garry Bailey, president of the N.W.T. Métis Nation, said this type of agreement should be replicated for other Indigenous governments. \"That's something the procurement strategy needs to look at for the rest of us, not just one group,\" he said. Gruner and Comeau said the N.W.T. could consider replicating what worked in Yukon's recent consultation on their new Indigenous procurement policy. \"[Yukon's review process] was driven by business and Indigenous communities,\" Comeau said. \"Businesses know what needs to be fixed … we just need to be willing to listen.\" Policies need annual review Everyone interviewed for this article agreed that the N.W.T.'s procurement strategy should be reviewed every few years in order to keep it current. They differ on timelines. Bailey suggests every two years at first to \"smooth out any kinks\" that might come up. That is also the best way, he said, to make sure a government to government relationship is in place. Minister Wawzonek has not committed to an ongoing timeline for reviewing procurement policies.","is_eligible":true,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fca.news.yahoo.com\u002Fn-w-t-procurement-policies-110054993.html","property":"News","categoryLabel":"News","title":"How the N.W.T.'s procurement policies could change to support northern, Indigenous businesses","images":{"img:220x123":{"height":123,"width":220,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fs.yimg.com\u002Fuu\u002Fapi\u002Fres\u002F1.2\u002FJ5cdeauX71dU_UXXDKYlAQ--~B\u002FZmk9c3RyaW07aD0xMjM7cT04MDt3PTIyMDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fs.yimg.com\u002Fuu\u002Fapi\u002Fres\u002F1.2\u002FvFpPrUmtt3gi6r_W8XUXUQ--~B\u002FaD0zNDM7dz02MjA7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fmedia.zenfs.com\u002Fen\u002Fcbc.ca\u002F6f294af3406f90af27f016bdcdbe37a3.cf.jpg"},"img:440x246":{"height":246,"width":440,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fs.yimg.com\u002Fuu\u002Fapi\u002Fres\u002F1.2\u002F456dLLMc3yCzQINDzewPpw--~B\u002FZmk9c3RyaW07aD0yNDY7cT04MDt3PTQ0MDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fs.yimg.com\u002Fuu\u002Fapi\u002Fres\u002F1.2\u002FvFpPrUmtt3gi6r_W8XUXUQ--~B\u002FaD0zNDM7dz02MjA7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fmedia.zenfs.com\u002Fen\u002Fcbc.ca\u002F6f294af3406f90af27f016bdcdbe37a3.cf.jpg"}},"type":"article","finance":{"stockTickers":null},"link":"\u002Fn-w-t-procurement-policies-110054993.html","id":"be57e07e-4b18-3dbe-a56a-602c442ccc67","publisher":"CBC","comments_allowed":"false","publisher_id":"cbc.ca","off_network":false},{"i13n":{"bpos":1,"cpos":13,"cposy":18},"summary":"COPENHAGEN — Six weeks after one of the worst landslides in modern Norway’s history, search teams have found two more bodies in the rubble, authorities said.

Helicopters and drones with heat-detecting cameras had flown over the ravaged hillside in Ask, which has a population of around 5,000 residents and is part of the Gjerdrum municipality. The landslide destroyed at least nine buildings with more than 30 apartments in the village, located 25 kilometres (16 miles) northeast of Oslo. After the two latest bodies were found, police spokeswoman Mari Stoltenberg said late Tuesday there was now an increased hope of finding the last missing person. Stoltenberg said the victims, which haven't been identified yet, were found under two meters (more than six feet) of quick clay, which can rapidly change from solid to liquid form when it is disturbed. The exact cause of the landslide isn’t yet known. However, combined with excessive precipitation and damp winter weather, the quick clay may have contributed to the landslide. In 2005, Norwegian authorities warned people not to construct residential buildings in the Ask area, saying it was “a high-risk zone” for landslides, but houses were built there later in the decade. A landslide in central Norway in 1893 killed 116 people. It was reportedly up to 40 times bigger than the one in Ask, where somewhere between 1.4 million and 2 million cubic meters (49.4 million to 70.6 million cubic feet) of land tumbled down.

Some might have noticed work vans and trucks coming and going from the Mulgrave Road Theatre’s (MRT’s) RoadHouse property on Highway 16, Guysborough. These vehicles are signs that phase one of the development plan for this location is moving forward. Phase one of the two-phase plan involves reconfiguring the existing space for use as a temporary theatre. This involves creating a seating arrangement, an entrance and exit for patrons, as well as designated areas for actors offstage. Work on security, communication and accessibility features at the RoadHouse have been ongoing this fall and winter. Phase two, which may begin as early as this summer, will include an addition and further renovations to the existing building. The firm Solterre Design of Halifax has been commissioned to create the schematic design for phase two, the completion of Mulgrave Road Theatre’s vision for the RoadHouse. The preliminary plans for the RoadHouse include, but are not limited to: a theatre space, offices, bathrooms and lobby. While the future of live productions remains uncertain due to the pandemic, a script continues to be in development by Mary-Colin Chisholm based on the 1829 Guysborough murder mystery involving the death of Dr. Henry Inch. MRT’s Artist Director Emmy Alcorn told The Journal on Monday (Feb. 8), “We are exploring all of our options with the hope that we can present something this summer.” Alcorn noted that although numerous public health restrictions regarding COVID-19 have been lifted this week, there’s much planning and preparation that needs to be done before any production can be announced with certainty. Work on the RoadHouse renovation project has been funded in part by ACOA, Canadian Heritage and Nova Scotia Communities, Culture and Heritage.

We are from a small town. so everyone's really close.\" Because of the pandemic, high schools in New Brunswick have been required to implement a blended learning model, with the student population alternating between in-person classes and at-home learning every other day. That means some students have been separated from their friends. \"I was most looking forward to just the day-to-day stuff like sitting with your friends on the bench in the morning, or just going out to lunch with everyone, but now you don't even see half your grad class or half your friends, even at school,\" said one student, who was interviewed for the documentary. Melvin said the blended model has also affected the quality of the education she and her peers are getting, which has led to concerns over being accepted to university or college. \"Math and sciences, they're easy enough to separate the curriculum online and in school.\" she said. \"But for arts classes and more of the electives, they're harder to do at home, so you're really not getting any substance in the class.\" Balancing restrictions with mental health worries Student mental health is an issue the Department of Education takes seriously, but the blended learning model for high school students will remain in place, said Education Minister Dominic Cardy. In an interview Tuesday, he said concern for student mental health is the reason he pushed to keep schools open as much as possible throughout the pandemic, in order to give students as much opportunity to interact with their peers. Cardy said the department is also working to provide additional counselling services and accelerate work to expand the range of options for student mental health supports. \"COVID-19 is obviously the number one concern, but the mental health concerns are number two, and that's part of the reason that I've been very strong in trying to push the schools to remain open as much as possible. \"As long as Public Health tells me that it's safe, I want the schools to be open for exactly those reasons, that absolutely the academic concerns are there as well, but this is a year when around the world schooling has been completely upset.\" Pandemic coincides with pivotal developmental period High school students are particularly prone to being affected by the changes that have been brought on by the pandemic, said Dr. Sarah Dow-Fleisner, an assistant professor in the school of social work at the University of British Columbia's Okanagan campus. \"Adolescents are in a really unique developmental stage,\" Dow-Fleisner said. \"This is really the fist time when we think of cognitive development, that they have some of the abilities now to think really abstractly, to have some complex ways of thinking, so they're recognizing more than young children that this has long-lasting impacts.\" They're also at a stage where they're typically moving away from identifying with family groups, and gravitating instead to peer groups. However, that natural development has been \"roadblocked\" by the pandemic and the restrictions they have to live with at school and in the community. \"They're staying at home. They're not necessarily having those peer interactions that are informal.\" Coping with an unusual year It's important for teachers and parents to offer consistent messaging to adolescents on the importance of mask-wearing, hand hygiene and social distancing to keep them and their community safe, Dow-Fleisner said. At the same time, simple practices such as maintaining a routine can help students feel a sense of normalcy even amid the other changes, she said. \"One of the biggest losses by not going to school regularly is a lack of routine. This can lead to poor sleeping habits and sedentary behaviour, all of which can affect mental health. \"So finding a way to keep a routine [is important] even if you have an online class.\"","is_eligible":true,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fca.news.yahoo.com\u002Fhigh-school-students-education-during-120000608.html","property":"News","categoryLabel":"News","title":"High school students say education during pandemic taking mental health toll","images":{"img:220x123":{"height":123,"width":220,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fs.yimg.com\u002Fuu\u002Fapi\u002Fres\u002F1.2\u002Fyug7CAev34brkyqoicMj4A--~B\u002FZmk9c3RyaW07aD0xMjM7cT04MDt3PTIyMDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fs.yimg.com\u002Fuu\u002Fapi\u002Fres\u002F1.2\u002FR02lHoQaQpi79thfnr0xIw--~B\u002FaD0zNDk7dz02MjA7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fmedia.zenfs.com\u002Fen\u002Fcbc.ca\u002Fd7646470c57a7af6939d833825e897ac.cf.jpg"},"img:440x246":{"height":246,"width":440,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fs.yimg.com\u002Fuu\u002Fapi\u002Fres\u002F1.2\u002FRFK8p4n8HOlPysXGBd.KGQ--~B\u002FZmk9c3RyaW07aD0yNDY7cT04MDt3PTQ0MDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fs.yimg.com\u002Fuu\u002Fapi\u002Fres\u002F1.2\u002FR02lHoQaQpi79thfnr0xIw--~B\u002FaD0zNDk7dz02MjA7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fmedia.zenfs.com\u002Fen\u002Fcbc.ca\u002Fd7646470c57a7af6939d833825e897ac.cf.jpg"}},"type":"article","finance":{"stockTickers":null},"link":"\u002Fhigh-school-students-education-during-120000608.html","id":"555e31dc-4ccf-3d5d-8e09-707b427bef31","publisher":"CBC","comments_allowed":"false","publisher_id":"cbc.ca","off_network":false},{"i13n":{"bpos":1,"cpos":16,"cposy":21},"summary":"An emergency room nurse at Winnipeg's St. Boniface Hospital is struggling to provide care to three patients with COVID-19. Two of them are screaming at her. They want to leave the ER. They're homeless. She's scrambling to find them a place in Winnipeg where they can self-isolate. Meanwhile, an elderly woman has been rushed in from a personal care home unable to breathe. Her COVID-19 symptoms are so severe, the nurse has been told the woman will die. \"You just look at it and go like, 'I can't. I'm one person,'\" the nurse told CBC News later, through tears. \"How do you decide where to go? How do you decide who to look after?\" She knew if she didn't stop the first two patients who were homeless from leaving the ER, they could spread COVID-19 in the community. She had no choice but to leave the elderly patient, she said. \"To know that there was someone dying alone in a room, and there was no help — no one was with her. I've never had a day like that before,\" the nurse said. \"It still bothers me,\" she said. \"I just keep thinking if that was a family member of mine.\" CBC News interviewed 10 emergency room nurses who work in Winnipeg and surrounding areas and say they feel abandoned by Manitoba's Department of Health and their own union. CBC has agreed to withhold their names because they fear they could lose their jobs for speaking out In December, the province signed a deal with the Manitoba Nurses Union to provide a temporary pay bump to nurses working in intensive care, COVID-19 wards, and personal care homes. The emergency room nurses were left out of the deal. \"The [agreement] completely disregarded emergency,\" one nurse said. \"Our union didn't even acknowledge that that had happened.\" After that, more than 200 ER nurses signed a letter to the province and their union looking for more support. The nurses CBC News spoke to said those concerns have been ignored. They have now taken their concerns to politicians with Manitoba's Opposition NDP as well as CBC, hoping the public will demand the province do more to support them. 'This place sucks the soul out of you' The nurses CBC interviewed for this story work at emergency rooms in Winnipeg's St. Boniface Hospital, Health Sciences Centre and Grace Hospital, as well as the Selkirk Regional Health Centre just north of the city. They say they face serious risks in the pandemic the public might not be aware of. Most patients enter the hospital through the emergency department. That means ER nurses often screen, test, and treat people for COVID-19 before they are triaged elsewhere. And unlike those working in intensive care units (ICUs) or COVID wards, ER nurses don't know whether someone being rushed into their care has the virus or not. They'll do CPR not knowing whether the person they are trying to save is infectious, they said. \"They've got their faces down doing compressions on a patient. You're probably six inches away from their face while you're doing this. So you're high, high risk,\" one nurse said. Some ER nurses with more than a dozen years of experience say they've never dealt with this many severely ill patients at a time — or this much death. When someone dies, the nurses said they don't have time to comfort families — they have to run to the next emergency. \"It is heart-wrenching to hear people grieve … I'm embarrassed with the way we care for these people's families,\" one nurse said. \"This place sucks the soul out of you,\" another added. I'm embarrassed with the way we care for these people's families. - Winnipeg emergency room nurse Many are now required to work 16-hour shifts to make sure the emergency department is staffed. \"Do you want to come to emergency and know that 90 per cent of the nurses there are on their 15th hour of work? I wouldn't,\" one said. \"It's not safe for the patients.\" $6 extra an hour The last time Manitoba's nurses were given a pay raise was four years ago — long before they were fighting a pandemic. The Manitoba Nurses Union has been without a contract with the Department of Health since March 2017. When the union signed the temporary pay increase for some nurses in December, it allowed the province to change those nurses' assignments, shifts, and work locations to deal with the pandemic. \"As emergency departments are not currently an area where staff are being redeployed, they were not included in the [agreement],\" a spokesperson for the province wrote in an email. Emergency room nurses say the deal amounts to $6 an hour extra — a hike they are happy to see their colleagues in other departments get, but one they say all frontline nurses deserve. The union said it tried to get the ER nurses included in the wage increase, but the province told them they only had a certain amount of funding. ER nurses quitting Emergency room nurses say they are now making difficult decisions about a job they love. \"There are a lot of days now for myself that I question, do I want to be an emergency nurse still? That is really hard,\" one nurse said. \"We have lost so many of our very good senior staff members to take other jobs, [because] they need to not feel like they're failing as a nurse in this profession, when it's really because we just don't have the resources,\" another said. The NDP's Health critic said this could leave a lasting mark on Manitoba's health-care system as the pandemic drags on — and for years to come. \"These are folks who have a tremendous amount of training and education and commitment to doing this work. So it's a huge loss if and when they walk away. And I know the nurses have walked away,\" Uzoma Asagwara said. \"They've reached their breaking point.\" The province said its making efforts throughout the system to make sure nurses are supported, but did not elaborate on what those are. \"Nurses across the health-care system are making valuable contributions to our COVID-19 fight and we thank them for their professionalism and commitment to providing outstanding care during this unprecedented time,\" a provincial spokesperson wrote in an email to CBC. The 10 ER nurses said it's hurtful to hear the Manitoba government praise them in writing, but not hear their concerns or provide a clear plan to support them. \"We're really not superheroes, actually,\" one nurse said. \"We're really just humans, just like everyone else. And we do have a threshold. And there's only so much that one person can do.\" We're really not superheroes, actually. We're really just humans. - Winnipeg emergency room nurse","is_eligible":true,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fca.news.yahoo.com\u002Fleft-covid-19-pay-bump-110000615.html","property":"Health","categoryLabel":"Health","title":"Left out of the COVID-19 pay bump, Manitoba ER nurses say they feel abandoned by province, union","images":{"img:220x123":{"height":123,"width":220,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fs.yimg.com\u002Fuu\u002Fapi\u002Fres\u002F1.2\u002F.9MA9zlji6wEsYMZAIx8xA--~B\u002FZmk9c3RyaW07aD0xMjM7cT04MDt3PTIyMDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fs.yimg.com\u002Fuu\u002Fapi\u002Fres\u002F1.2\u002FgfSz0SIgzmOXgQ38W8041g--~B\u002FaD0zNDk7dz02MjA7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fmedia.zenfs.com\u002Fen\u002Fcbc.ca\u002F341fca87682a7bcf5929e330ecc0827f.cf.jpg"},"img:440x246":{"height":246,"width":440,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fs.yimg.com\u002Fuu\u002Fapi\u002Fres\u002F1.2\u002FxxtzSPeUKdY7YLCF0lKQ8w--~B\u002FZmk9c3RyaW07aD0yNDY7cT04MDt3PTQ0MDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fs.yimg.com\u002Fuu\u002Fapi\u002Fres\u002F1.2\u002FgfSz0SIgzmOXgQ38W8041g--~B\u002FaD0zNDk7dz02MjA7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fmedia.zenfs.com\u002Fen\u002Fcbc.ca\u002F341fca87682a7bcf5929e330ecc0827f.cf.jpg"}},"type":"article","finance":{"stockTickers":null},"link":"\u002Fleft-covid-19-pay-bump-110000615.html","id":"18c89fd4-0295-3c87-91cb-b8c7b1ed4fe9","publisher":"CBC","comments_allowed":"false","publisher_id":"cbc.ca","off_network":false},{"i13n":{"bpos":1,"cpos":17,"cposy":22},"summary":"Canadian Reynolds, famed for starring in superhero comedy \"Deadpool\", and American actor McElhenney, creator and star of sitcom, \"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia\", first expressed interest in investing in the club in September.  \"We can now pursue our goal to grow the team and return it to the English Football League (EFL) in front of increased attendances, and in an improved stadium, while making a positive difference to the wider community in Wrexham,\" Reynolds and McElhenney said in a joint statement https:\u002F\u002Fwww.wrexhamafc.co.uk\u002Fnews\u002Fstatement-rob-mcelhenney-and-ryan-reynolds-officially-confirmed-as-wrexham-afc-owners.","is_eligible":true,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fca.news.yahoo.com\u002Factors-reynolds-mcelhenney-complete-wrexham-093916808.html","property":"Sports","categoryLabel":"Sports","title":"Actors Reynolds, McElhenney complete Wrexham takeover","images":{"img:220x123":{"height":123,"width":220,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fs.yimg.com\u002Fuu\u002Fapi\u002Fres\u002F1.2\u002FGsrCnvsTkobG4_h4PkmCSg--~B\u002FZmk9c3RyaW07aD0xMjM7cT04MDt3PTIyMDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fs.yimg.com\u002Fuu\u002Fapi\u002Fres\u002F1.2\u002FCwIBsoU2bHNTl9TjK09..A--~B\u002FaD01MzM7dz04MDA7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fmedia.zenfs.com\u002Fen\u002Freuters.com\u002F81c8164e0c03ad8185f36f179ecb232a.cf.jpg"},"img:440x246":{"height":246,"width":440,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fs.yimg.com\u002Fuu\u002Fapi\u002Fres\u002F1.2\u002FoeCqav5UrKfKz90p1c37tQ--~B\u002FZmk9c3RyaW07aD0yNDY7cT04MDt3PTQ0MDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fs.yimg.com\u002Fuu\u002Fapi\u002Fres\u002F1.2\u002FCwIBsoU2bHNTl9TjK09..A--~B\u002FaD01MzM7dz04MDA7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fmedia.zenfs.com\u002Fen\u002Freuters.com\u002F81c8164e0c03ad8185f36f179ecb232a.cf.jpg"}},"type":"article","finance":{"stockTickers":null},"link":"\u002Factors-reynolds-mcelhenney-complete-wrexham-093916808.html","id":"804904c7-812b-313f-bd81-0e5588ecad2d","publisher":"Reuters","comments_allowed":"false","publisher_id":"reuters.com","off_network":false},{"i13n":{"bpos":1,"cpos":18,"cposy":23},"summary":"JERUSALEM — Mendy Moskowits, a member of the ultra-Orthodox Belz Hassidic sect in Jerusalem, doesn’t understand the uproar toward believers like him. In recent weeks, ultra-Orthodox Jews have defied coronavirus restrictions by holding big funerals for beloved rabbis who died of COVID-19, celebrating large weddings, and continuing to send their children to schools. The gatherings have led to clashes with police and an unprecedented wave of public anger toward the religious community. On Tuesday night, hundreds of ultra-Orthodox demonstrators protested lockdown restrictions, set dumpsters on fire, and faced off with police officers in Jerusalem. Moskowits, like many other ultra-Orthodox faithful, says Israeli society doesn't understand their way of life and has turned his community into a scapegoat. “The media gives us, in my opinion, a very bad misrepresentation,” he said. The ultra-Orthodox community makes up about 12% of Israel’s 9.3 million people. Gilad Malach, a researcher at the Israel Democracy Institute, says ultra-Orthodox believers accounted for over a third of the country’s COVID-19 cases in 2020. Among Israelis over 65, the community's mortality rate was three times that of the general population, he added. Health Ministry data show vaccination rates in ultra-Orthodox areas lag far behind the national average. But the ultra-Orthodox community has wielded outsize influence, using its kingmaker status in parliament to secure benefits and generous government subsidies. Ultra-Orthodox men are exempt from compulsory military service and often collect welfare payments while continuing to study full time in seminaries throughout adulthood. Their schools enjoy broad autonomy and focus almost entirely on religion while shunning basic subjects like math and science. These privileges have generated disdain from the general public — resentment that has boiled over into outright hostility during the coronavirus crisis. Ultra-Orthodox noncompliance, Malach said, stemmed in part from members not believing that they \"need to obey the rules of the state, especially regarding questions of religious behaviour.” Ultra-Orthodox, also known as “Haredim,” follow a strict interpretation of Judaism, and prominent rabbis are the community’s arbiters in all matters. Many consider secular Israelis a recent aberration from centuries of unaltered Jewish tradition. “We have rabbis. We don’t just do what we have in our minds,” Moskowits said. “We have listened to them for a few thousand years. We will listen to them today as well.” While the ultra-Orthodox community is far from monolithic, many rabbis have either ignored or even intentionally flouted safety rules. The 93-year-old Rabbi Chaim Kanievsky, one of the most influential spiritual leaders, has insisted schools remain open throughout the crisis. On a recent day, scores of ultra-Orthodox girls cascaded from a grade school in the Romema neighbourhood that was operating in violation of the law. Few wore masks or maintained distance from others. Classes went on at nearby boys’ elementary schools and yeshivas. “We can’t have a generation go bust,” said Moskowits, who lives in Romema. “We are still sending our boys to school because we have rabbis who say Torah study saves and protects.\" In a community that largely shuns the internet, rabbis plaster “pashkevils,” or public notices, on walls in religious neighbourhoods to spread their messages. Some notices urged people not to get vaccinated, even using Holocaust imagery to scare people. “The vaccine is completely unnecessary! The pandemic is already behind us!” one read, comparing the rush for vaccinations to boarding a train to the Auschwitz death camp. Ultra-Orthodox leaders say such views are held by a radical minority. Most people respect safety rules, they say, and the virus is spreading because communities are poor and people live in small apartments with large families. Moskowits, a 29-year-old father of two, said some families have up to 10 children and just one bathroom. From 14, boys are sent to boarding schools and spend only the sabbath at home. For many, lockdown “technically, physically doesn’t work,” Moskowits said. He called it a “human rights violation.” Moskowits, who grew up in the U.K., speaks English with a British accent, but his vocabulary is heavily seasoned with Yiddish and Hebrew words. He wears the black velvet skullcap, pressed white shirt and black slacks typical of ultra-Orthodox men -- but no mask, despite the government requiring them in public. He said he contracted COVID-19 in March and claims a letter from his doctor excuses him from wearing a mask. A real estate developer, he punctuates his workday with prayers at a neighbourhood synagogue, and tries once a week to pray at Jerusalem's Western Wall, the holiest place where Jews can worship. Once a day, he performs ablutions at a mikvah, a Jewish ritual bath, and he regularly studies religious texts with a partner. The religious community is growing rapidly even though economists have long warned that the system is unsustainable. About 60% of its population is under 19, according to the Israel Democracy Institute. Protecting the ultra-Orthodox way of life — or Yiddishkeit — is the community’s ultimate aim. If that means infections spread, that’s a price some members are willing to pay. Ultra-Orthodox people “sacrifice most of their lives for the next generation and for preserving Yiddishkeit. We give away everything,” Moskowits said. This view is hardly universal. Nathan Slifkin, an Orthodox rabbi living in Israel, complained in a recent op-ed in the Jewish Chronicle that members of the Haredi community “genuinely see no connection between flouting the restrictions and people dying from COVID.” Yehuda Meshi-Zahav, head of an ultra-Orthodox ambulance service called ZAKA, lost both his parents to the virus in January. He says rabbis urging followers to violate coronavirus regulations have “blood on their hands.” Funerals play a central role in traditional Jewish life, and the pandemic has made them all too common. Cars with megaphones drive through religious neighbourhoods announcing deaths and funeral details. Pashkevils notify communities when a prominent rabbi dies. Shmuel Gelbstein, deputy director of a Jerusalem funeral society for the ultra-Orthodox community, said this year has been “very busy, very difficult regarding mortality, both when it comes to ordinary deaths, plus of course coronavirus, which is certainly an amount that adds to the load.” Funerals for two leading Haredi rabbis who died of COVID-19 each drew an estimated 10,000 mourners last week. Israel’s non-Orthodox majority was outraged at what they saw as contempt for the rules and selective enforcement by authorities.

Moskowits explained that for the young men who flocked to these funerals, prominent rabbis are “a huge part of your life.” “When these younger guys go to a funeral, they feel that their father died,” he said. “Nothing stands in the way.

Chad Gaffield, a history professor at the University of Ottawa, says the collections of Library and Archives Canada are the foundations of understanding Canada's history and without them research in the field is impossible. Before the lockdown in Ontario, researchers could make appointments at Library and Archives Canada building in Ottawa to view documents in its reading room but the building doors have now been closed for weeks. \"That's going to, inevitably, have a have an impact on which projects can be done now and which projects are going to have to wait,\" Gaffield said. Johanna Smith, Library and Archives Canada's director general of public services, said decisions on public access to the collections have been aligned throughout the pandemic with public health advice that varies across the country. On-site services are now closed in Ottawa and Winnipeg, but they are available to the public in Vancouver with social distancing measures in place. In Halifax, Library and Archives Canada's public service point at the Pier 21 Museum will be closed until April due to renovations. Greg Bak, a history professor at the University of Manitoba, said his students often have assignments that require them to use archives. \"It's been challenging,\" he said. Still, Bak said they have been able to make a transition to online teaching using video calls to conduct virtual archives tours for students. \"The local archival community has been tremendously helpful and supportive,\" he said. Gaffield said some research projects require researchers to spend long days looking at archival materials at Library and Archives Canada. \"I did a project, some years ago, and we actually ... were there physically every day for two years,\" he said. Library and Archives Canada is also dealing with a backlog of access to information requests. \"We had a long queue of requests before the pandemic started,\" Smith said. \"Because staff were working from home, they couldn't come in and contact the collections.\" She said other government departments can answer access to information requests because they're mostly digital. The backlog is a result of both the lack of human resources required to process the requests and the increasing interest in government records, Smith said. The requests are known as \"ATIPs,\" for the access to information and privacy acts that govern them. \"That increase, it goes up by at least 50 per cent to 100 per cent every year. We've seen those increases since about 2015 onwards,\" she said. \"We've kind of done a sort of review across government of how ATIP budgets are allocated and we know that we're giving a lot already to ATIP, and we just need more.\" She said the COVID-19 pandemic has shown the need to digitize the collections faster. Smith said Library and Archives Canada doesn't have a dedicated digitization budget, but there are programs every year to digitize as much material as possible. \"We try to focus on where things are the most popular, but it's still a small amount of what we need to do,\" she said. Smith said the holdings of Library and Archives Canada amount to about 250 kilometres of shelves full of archival documents stored in Vancouver, Winnipeg, Ottawa, Gatineau, Que. and Renfrew, Ont. New storage vaults are being built in Gatineau next to the current preservation centre there. \"We think the world has gone digital but we still get transfers of paper records every year from notable Canadians, from the government, from publishers who transfer us collections,\" she said. \"The move to digital is coming slowly in terms of the collections that we're getting.\" Bak said digitizing the archival documents of Library and Archives Canada is problematic. He said academics often need to access documents no one has looked at before. \"What is the cost-benefit here in terms of digitizing these record sets, which may only be used by a small handful of academic researchers?\" he said. Digitization also presents legal complications as entire classes of records cannot be copied and circulated due to laws around copyright, legitimate government secrecy, and privacy. \"Indigenous communities have been effectively under government surveillance for hundreds of years, and the records of this surveillance are government records ... Opening up these records would deprive Indigenous people of their privacy unfairly,\" he said. Digitizing the archival materials also will create a double burden for preservation because there will be a need to preserve both the original records and the new digital versions. \"Digital technologies are always changing, so maintaining the physical copies requires ongoing monitoring for data loss, data degradation and obsolescence. And then migrating them into new formats as formats become obsolete,\" he said.

Ella is one of the more than 7,100 students now at home, as the Newfoundland and Labrador English School District has suspended classes at 12 of its schools in the St. John's area for at least Tuesday and Wednesday in the wake of two students testing positive at Mount Pearl Senior High on the weekend. Three other schools in the metro area outside the NLESD's jurisdiction have also followed suit. As relieved as Ella was, she wasn't surprised by the closure. She has multiple friends in isolation at the moment, having been identified as close contacts, she said, with anxiety and stress for them and for herself building, and hard to keep at bay. \"You're just waiting for the call. Like you never know if you're going to be the next one, and it feels like you're walking on thin ice,\" she said. Ella knows what's at stake. Her grandmother tested positive for COVID-19 in the spring, after travelling home from Florida, an experience that has stuck with her long after her grandmother's recovery. She's been following the public health guidelines, she said, but simply being at school makes that practically impossible. \"It's hard to keep your bubble to 20 people when they're going to school with like 600 people,\" she said, adding that there has also been a lot of overlap between high schools via activities like sports teams. Online learning welcomed Teachers and staff at all affected NLESD schools — save Mount Pearl Senior High, where everyone remains in isolation — reported to work Tuesday to begin preparations for a potential move to online learning, although no guidelines on if or when that could happen have been made public. Ella said she would welcome a temporary move to learning from home. \"I think the teachers will know how to make it work, and I have belief in all the teachers,\" she said. Abby Mitchell, a Grade 12 student at Holy Spirit, also wants to see a shift to online learning. It may be at a crucial point of studies for her, in the final months of her final year, but she believes the plans the district has made so far for this possibility will work. I don't think that's an unreasonable ask, to be protected. - Sarah Healey \"I think that as a province, we're in this together, and we're actually ahead of other provinces in the country. So I think we're going to be OK. I fully trust my teachers,\" said Abby, who is also the school's student council president. Both Abby and Ella are set up with their own personal laptops and devices to be able to pivot to online classes, but they know of other students who aren't so fortunate. \"I know it's definitely a stress factor,\" said Abby. \"We were told we were all going to have Chromebooks at the start of the year, and we're in the second semester now, and very few of us have actually received that.\" The CEO of the NLESD, Tony Stack, said Tuesday there has been a delay in getting Chromebooks to the province due to a worldwide shortage but students who need technology have been identified and tech solutions found. Keep schools closed, say students On Tuesday, public health confirmed community transmission is occurring in the St. John's area, as 30 new cases of COVID-19 were reported in the province: all in the Eastern Health region, with 14 of them under the age of 19. No new school cases were identified outside Mount Pearl Senior, said Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Janice Fitzgerald. She did not say if the current school closures would be extended, but said public health and the school district are working closely together, as other community restrictions outside classrooms have come into effect for two weeks. \"As the information changes, we may have to change our response with that, but we are trying to reduce spread through the community. If we keep our community safe, we can keep our schools safe,\" Fitzgerald said. The idea of a return to school sooner than two weeks — the incubation period of the virus — doesn't sit well with Gonzaga High Grade 10 student Kaitlin Healey. \"I think it was smart of them to close the high schools, but I feel like everything should be closed for a 14-day period … at minimum,\" Kaitlin said. \"I don't think that's an unreasonable ask, to be protected,\" said her sister Sarah Healey, in Grade 11. All the students CBC News spoke to urged public health officials to not rush back to school. Kaitlin said it comes down to safety: she knows first-hand what it feels like to be in a crowded classroom where other students have their masks pushed down past their noses or chins. \"I don't feel safe going into a classroom with like 30 to 40 other children, and about 20 to 30 the kids aren't wearing their masks properly,\" she said. Balancing those physical risks are mental ones. \"It's very difficult to deal with the last-minute snap of things,\" said Sarah, of the consecutive late-night closure announcements from the school district. The teenagers are gifted with technological literacy, and are using it to their advantage amid the uncertainty to try to take care of themselves, and their friends. Abby said she's been FaceTiming her best friend constantly, while Ella said she's also keeping up contacts, but trying to avoid negativity online. Her advice for getting through it works for any age. \"I'm trying to stay away from sources I don't know, and just take it day by day and listen to all the health professionals,\" Ella said. She hopes the health professionals are listening to students like her, and what they hope to see in the coming days: staying home, with their families. \"I just think that being in school right now is just one of the worst possible things, because every couple of minutes someone else is texting, being like, 'I have to isolate,'\" said Ella. \"If we were all in school right now, we'd have so many more cases.\" Read more from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador","is_eligible":true,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fca.news.yahoo.com\u002Fn-l-teens-now-school-103000398.html","property":"News","categoryLabel":"News","title":"These N.L. teens are now out of school.

Sixteen years later, she's hearing from friends on the ground who fear COVID-19 will be a worse pandemic. \"They're telling me they're scared,\" said Warren, who maintains contact with community leaders in the region of Manzini. A high school that she visited in 2005 has been closed for most of the past year. The principal, Bheki Zwane, says he has no way to check on the welfare of his students. They have no access to the internet or phones, he said, and many relied on the school for their main, maybe only, meal of the day. \"A lot of these children are coming from child-headed homes,\" said Zwane. \"They don't have a mother. They don't have a father.\" Of the 860 students enrolled at Zombodze National High School, 500 are classified as orphans or vulnerable because they lack the basic needs for survival. \"And we don't even know how they're coping,\" he said. HIV positive patients at risk In 2018, the king of Swaziland renamed the country Eswatini. Today, it has the highest rate of HIV infection in the world. Nearly a third of the adult population is HIV positive. \"We thought we would never see a pandemic that would square with HIV,\" said Thandi Nhlengethwa, executive director of the AIDS Information and Support Centre. \"Then COVID was on our doorstep.\" In the past few months, COVID has been linked to the deaths of two Eswatini cabinet ministers, the country's Anglican bishop and its 52-year-old prime minister. Nhlengethwa says patients can live with HIV for many years but COVID seems to be killing her compatriots quickly. \"With COVID, you're dead in the space of maybe 14 days,\" she said. Now she's worried to what extent healthcare resources will be diverted to managing this newest threat. \"We can't have a patient default on HIV treatment. That is suicide,\" she said. No vaccine Dr. Bernhard Kerschberger says there's been a lot of pressure to put more resources into the COVID response. As project manager with Médecins Sans Frontières in Eswatini, Kerschberger has been occupied with HIV and the country's high burden of tuberculosis. In 2011, the government declared TB a national emergency. \"We can see it's very difficult now for the health system to actually cope with this triple pandemic -- HIV, TB and corona,\" said Kerschberger. Still, he's optimistic that COVID vaccine will start arriving later this month through the COVAX initiative. That's a program that was launched last year by the World Health Organization. It was created in part so wealthier countries could help drive vaccine development with the expectation that lower income countries would later benefit. Canada is a participant, having invested $440 million, half of which paid to secure vaccine for Canadians. The other half will help buy doses for the 92 countries that do need help. \"In Africa, almost no countries have received the vaccine so far,\" said Kershberger. \"And I think it's a bit sad to see because at the beginning of the pandemic, there was a lot of talk about a global approach, about solidarity ... but at the moment, I don't think we see a lot of solidarity.\" In an interview from Mbabane, the country's executive capital, on Tuesday, Kerschberger said he expected Eswatini would be getting the AstraZeneca vaccine. A few hours later, Reuters reported that Eswatini was rejecting that vaccine. The decision was made after a trial showed it gave minimal protection against mild-to-moderate COVID-19 caused by the dominant variant in South Africa.","is_eligible":true,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fca.news.yahoo.com\u002Fthree-pandemics-zero-vaccines-nb-110000129.html","property":"News","categoryLabel":"News","title":"Three pandemics, zero vaccines: NB AIDS workers take distressing calls from southern Africa","images":{"img:220x123":{"height":123,"width":220,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fs.yimg.com\u002Fuu\u002Fapi\u002Fres\u002F1.2\u002F4PUKYZyXngySbgveP6rApw--~B\u002FZmk9c3RyaW07aD0xMjM7cT04MDt3PTIyMDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fs.yimg.com\u002Fuu\u002Fapi\u002Fres\u002F1.2\u002FwyEvhYDEaf81WF2I2dDSiQ--~B\u002FaD00MTM7dz02MjA7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fmedia.zenfs.com\u002Fen\u002Fcbc.ca\u002F17a038c6855149c04a2c8bf878d27679.cf.jpg"},"img:440x246":{"height":246,"width":440,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fs.yimg.com\u002Fuu\u002Fapi\u002Fres\u002F1.2\u002FQqBeW.U5_tXmWNSCKCe7kQ--~B\u002FZmk9c3RyaW07aD0yNDY7cT04MDt3PTQ0MDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fs.yimg.com\u002Fuu\u002Fapi\u002Fres\u002F1.2\u002FwyEvhYDEaf81WF2I2dDSiQ--~B\u002FaD00MTM7dz02MjA7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fmedia.zenfs.com\u002Fen\u002Fcbc.ca\u002F17a038c6855149c04a2c8bf878d27679.cf.jpg"}},"type":"article","finance":{"stockTickers":null},"link":"\u002Fthree-pandemics-zero-vaccines-nb-110000129.html","id":"14195954-a2cc-3584-a72b-6b376410df6d","publisher":"CBC","comments_allowed":"false","publisher_id":"cbc.ca","off_network":false},{"i13n":{"bpos":1,"cpos":22,"cposy":27},"summary":"A troubling new outbreak of COVID-19 in the metro St. John's area means another setback for the battered hospitality industry, but business leaders say they're ready to do their part to help contain the virus. \"There's far-reaching impacts of the decision, but always for the right reasons,\" said Don-E Coady, spokesperson for the George Street Association, which represents 21 bars and restaurants in downtown St. John's. Brenda O'Reilly, who chairs Hospitality Newfoundland and Labrador's board of directors, agrees. \"Right now I implore all businesses in tourism and hospitality to look to the protocols that the public health has put out there and to adhere to them and to enforce them to help get COVID-19 under control,\" she said. Coady and O'Reilly were responding to an expanded special measures order imposed Tuesday afternoon as Dr. Janice Fitzgerald, the province's chief medical officer of health, announced a spike in cases, likely associated with a cluster that involves a high school in Mount Pearl. 30 new cases in a single day The order required bars in the St. John's region to close their doors as of midnight Tuesday, for at least two weeks, and for restaurants to reduce their capacity to 50 per cent. Establishments that serve food and alcohol can remain open. The expanded measures are in response to 30 new cases reported on Tuesday, bringing the total number of active cases in the province to 57. N.L. had reported 11 cases on Monday. Tuesday's numbers represented the second-highest single-day total since the start of the pandemic, and was only surpassed by the 32 cases announced March 25 during the province's first wave. Fitzgerald confirmed that there is now community transmission in the area, and that she expects more cases to be discovered in the coming days. In an attempt to contain the outbreak, Fitzgerald announced a series of measures she described as a \"circuit breaker.\" WATCH | Here & Now's Peter Cowan and Carolyn Stokes find answers to some key questions about the changing COVID-19 situation: For example, gatherings may not exceed 20 people, all group activities are suspended, and gyms and recreational facilities must close. Retail stores and malls can remain open, as well as personal service and animal grooming businesses. After months of very low numbers of the virus, the situation has rapidly changed, and the level of anxiety and fear that was so common during the early days of the pandemic has returned. And for the hospitality industry, it's another setback for a sector that has been struggling through unprecedented problems. If there's any upside for bars and restaurants, it's that the new measures come at a time when business is already lean because it's mid-winter, and many people were already staying away because of fear of the virus. \"It's sad to see any part of our sector close, but two weeks? Better the middle of February than the middle of July,\" said O'Reilly. \"All we want is to make sure that what has been happening can even out [and] for this to go away so everyone is front row centre to participate in every way possible to help make that happen,\" added Coady.

Here is what's on the radar of our editors for the morning of Feb. 10 ... What we are watching in Canada ... A Montreal cardiologist with a background in epidemiology says even with community spread of COVID-19 in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador can have a safe election on Saturday. McGill University professor Dr. Christopher Labos says it's not the election itself that's a concern but the possibility of people gathering in large numbers. Labos said Tuesday if venues are ventilated and if voters are masked and keep their distance from one another, then everything should be fine. Newfoundlanders and Labradorians will be heading to the polls days after health officials confirmed community spread of COVID-19 in the capital's metro region. And although officials announced stricter health measures in St. John's, shutting gyms, cinemas and bars, the chief electoral officer said Tuesday that voting day was still a go. Chief medical officer of health Dr. Janice Fitzgerald said Tuesday that going to a polling station where safety protocols are followed is no riskier than visiting a grocery store.--- Also this ... A judge is to hear arguments this week over whether Alberta's public inquiry into the purported foreign funding of environmental charities is a valid defence of the province's ailing oil industry or an attempt to silence dissent. Court of Queen's Bench Justice Karen Horner is to hear a challenge from environmental law charity Ecojustice on Thursday and Friday. The hearing's initial April date was delayed because of the COVID-19 pandemic. \"I can't recall an issue that has prompted so much public interest in recent times for an Ecojustice case, and overwhelming support,\" said executive director Devon Page. The inquiry was one plank in a \"fight-back\" strategy touted by the United Conservatives on the 2019 election campaign trail. Forensic accountant Steve Allan was tapped that summer to be commissioner with an initial $2.5-million budget and July 2020 deadline. Allan's report is expected on May 31 after three extensions and a $1-million budget increase. Page called the inquiry a \"political stunt that's not based in reality\" and wants it shut down. --- What we are watching in the U.S. ... Former President Donald Trump fumed that his attorneys’ performance on the opening day of his second impeachment trial was a disaster, as allies and Republican senators questioned the strategy and some called for yet another shakeup to his legal team. Trump, who was watching the proceedings in Washington from his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, was furious at what he saw, according to a person familiar with his thinking. Senators, too, criticized what they described as an unfocused and rambling performance as Trump's team and Democratic House managers began to lay out their cases in front of the Senate jury. While it remains unlikely that more than a handful of Republicans will join Democrats in convicting the former president at the end of the trial, the proceedings were a chance for Trump to try to repair some of the damage to his legacy incurred over the storming of the Capitol by a mob of his supporters. Trump has been charged with inciting the Jan. 6 insurrection, and last month he became the first president in history to be impeached by the House twice. But Trump's team — which was announced little more than a week ago — appeared unprepared as they attempted a good cop, bad cop routine that veered from flattery to legalese, and stood in dramatic contrast to Democrats' focused emotional appeals. Trump — ever the showman — was impressed with the Democrats, who opened Tuesday's session with powerful video that compiled scenes of the deadly attack on Congress. And he complained that his team — especially lead lawyer Bruce Castor — came off badly on television and looked weak in comparison, according to the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations. The anger was echoed by Trump allies, who blasted the lawyers both publicly and privately and with repeated profanities. --- What we are watching in the rest of the world ... A spacecraft from the United Arab Emirates swung into orbit around Mars on Tuesday in a triumph for the Arab world’s first interplanetary mission. Ground controllers at the UAE’s space centre in Dubai rose to their feet and broke into applause when word came that the craft, called Amal, Arabic for Hope, had reached the end of its seven-month, 300-million-mile journey and had begun circling the red planet, where it will gather detailed data on Mars’ atmosphere. The orbiter fired its main engines for 27 minutes in an intricate, high-stakes manoeuver that slowed the craft enough for it to be captured by Mars’ gravity. It took a nail-biting 11 minutes for the signal confirming success to reach Earth. Tensions were high: Over the years, Mars has been the graveyard for a multitude of missions from various countries. A visibly relieved Omran Sharaf, the mission’s director, declared, “To the people of the UAE and Arab and Islamic nations, we announce the success of the UAE reaching Mars.” Two more unmanned spacecraft from the U.S. and China are following close behind, set to arrive at Mars over the next several days. All three missions were launched in July to take advantage of the close alignment of Earth and Mars. --- On this day in 1906 ... Prince Rupert was chosen from 15,000 entries as the name of the Grand Trunk Railway's Pacific terminal. Eleanor Macdonald of Winnipeg won $250 for suggesting the name. --- In entertainment ... A brother of one of three women slain by their ex-partner in the Ottawa Valley has recruited Margaret Atwood for a music project about gender-based domestic violence. An awareness campaign by baritone Joshua Hopkins, whose sister Nathalie Warmerdam was murdered in 2015, caught the attention of Atwood and Florida-raised composer Jake Heggie. They agreed to join him in an effort to \"inspire other voices\" to the cause with an eight-track album of Atwood's poetry sung by Hopkins and with Heggie on piano. \"Songs for Murdered Sisters\" was co-commissioned by the Houston Grand Opera and the National Arts Centre Orchestra in Ottawa. The album will be released on March 5, shortly before International Women's Day. \"Songs for Murdered Sisters\" was inspired by the murders perpetrated by Basil Borutski, who was convicted in 2017 of first-degree murder in the deaths of Hopkins' sister, 48-year-old Warmerdam, and 36-year-old Anastasia Kuzyk. Borutski also was convicted of second-degree murder in the slaying of 66-year-old Carol Culleton. All three murders happened within an hour of each other on Sept. 22, 2015. Borutski had relationships with all three women and sought revenge for their supposed grievances against him, the court was told in his trial. --- ICYMI ... A program to cull invasive, non-migratory Canada geese in British Columbia's North Okanagan has the strong support of Vernon city council. Councillors have voted 6-1 in favour of the program to spend up to $40,000 to eliminate as many as 250 geese. Initial plans would see about 10 kayakers rounding up the geese at three Vernon-area beaches on Okanagan Lake, something Cumming says would have to be done annually, to keep numbers in check. Staff say a longer-term plan will be created and council was encouraged to maintain other options, including an egg addling program which destroys the embryo of fertilized eggs but leaves the eggs in the nest so geese do not lay more. Word of the cull has already prompted two separate petitions signed by nearly 2,000 opponents of the plan. In addition to addling, council has been told alternatives to a full-scale cull could include sport hunting and kill-to-scare, a process that removes a single animal from the flock, generally encouraging the birds to move to another location for a period of time. --- This report by The Canadian Press was first published Feb. 10, 2021 The Canadian Press","is_eligible":true,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fca.news.yahoo.com\u002Fn-l-election-safe-u-091500031.html","property":"Politics","categoryLabel":"Politics","title":"N.L.'s election is safe and U.A.E. spacecraft in Mars orbit: In The News for Feb. 10","images":{"img:220x123":{"height":123,"width":220,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fs.yimg.com\u002Fuu\u002Fapi\u002Fres\u002F1.2\u002F4qEIkVh67Ca31kGGmDfO4Q--~B\u002FZmk9c3RyaW07aD0xMjM7cT04MDt3PTIyMDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fs.yimg.com\u002Fuu\u002Fapi\u002Fres\u002F1.2\u002F6yR.4v2upeRxN.1HdPikpA--~B\u002FaD03MjA7dz0xMDU4O2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fmedia.zenfs.com\u002Fen\u002Fthe_canadian_press_huffpo_en_41\u002F37ed3b4f85daf276fd02348b8d1ef2e4.cf.jpg"},"img:440x246":{"height":246,"width":440,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fs.yimg.com\u002Fuu\u002Fapi\u002Fres\u002F1.2\u002F.MiOnRJZHuuYb.gQ7._F4g--~B\u002FZmk9c3RyaW07aD0yNDY7cT04MDt3PTQ0MDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fs.yimg.com\u002Fuu\u002Fapi\u002Fres\u002F1.2\u002F6yR.4v2upeRxN.1HdPikpA--~B\u002FaD03MjA7dz0xMDU4O2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u\u002Fhttps:\u002F\u002Fmedia.zenfs.com\u002Fen\u002Fthe_canadian_press_huffpo_en_41\u002F37ed3b4f85daf276fd02348b8d1ef2e4.cf.jpg"}},"type":"article","finance":{"stockTickers":null},"link":"\u002Fn-l-election-safe-u-091500031.html","id":"0feab902-ce2d-3c71-b0e2-5d2a1c4ff588","publisher":"The Canadian Press","comments_allowed":"false","publisher_id":"the_canadian_press_huffpo_en_41","off_network":false},{"i13n":{"bpos":1,"cpos":25,"cposy":30},"summary":"A majority of Canadians believe that governments at multiple levels should have acted sooner to reduce the number of coronavirus cases in the country, according to new polling from Ipsos.

The reefs below the waves are beautiful beyond description and the ocean life is fascinating. Each dive is different and there is more to learn than anyone could ever manage. This scuba diver has explored the waters in Belize, Mexico, Cayman Islands, Cuba, Galapagos Islands and Papua New Guinea. He has seen bizarre and wondrous creatures, but he has just found something unlike any other living organism that he has ever seen. Initially drawn to a shiny sphere nestled in the coral and sponges in Kimbe Bay, Papua New Guinea, this diver believed he was about to pick up a piece of glass or other litter that had been dropped overboard. As he drifted closer, it looked like it could even be a metallic ball. It was completely spherical and uniform in shape, roughly the size of a large chicken egg. Although experienced scuba divers are well acquainted with the rule not to touch the reefs or sea life, the one exception is that removing litter from the ocean is advisable in most cases. This diver drew closer and he was able to see the shine from his dive lights penetrating the outer surface, reflecting back at him from surfaces within the sphere. With a little imagination, he could now picture it as some alien object or well polished meteorite. As he reached for the strange object, he found the outside slightly springy. It was not metal or glass and he realized that felt like a peeled grape or even a huge eyeball. It was anchored to the coral and removing it would disturb the life around it. Reluctant to touch it further, he left it where it was and brought his video footage back to the dive ship. A dive instructor and photography expert on board explained that this was actually a species of algae and that it grew so large that it is believed to be the largest single celled organism on the planet. Aptly named \"bubble algae\" or 'sailor's eyeball\", they occupy most oceans throughout the world. Scientists are keen to use these algae in research because they make it easy to study the migration of water soluble compounds across biological membranes. The ocean is full of fascinating and wonderous creatures. We are only beginning to understand our environment and the life forms that share our
