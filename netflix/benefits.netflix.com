Options become valuable as the stock price appreciates above the exercise price. Netflix options are granted each month and expire 10 years from the grant date. \n\nA simple way to think of a stock option is to think of it like a coupon. The coupon is valuable to you when the regular price of the item is higher than what you can buy it for with your coupon, and once they expire they are longer valid. Let’s say you receive a coupon to buy an item at $100 until the printed expiration date. You go into the store and see that the retail price is $150. You redeem your coupon and buy it for $100, which saves you $50. In the context of stock options, you might have an option with an exercise price of $100. You exercise and sell your option later on when your stock price is $150, so your gain is $50!\n"},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"abx5xo923wy6"}},"id":"nAKCdbZhkWaCgUUWe02S0","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-09-18T01:29:50.594Z","updatedAt":"2021-01-16T02:06:13.163Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":32,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"sectionContent"}},"locale":"en-US"},"cmsTitle":"SOP \u003e Option Grants","sectionTitle":"Option Grants","sectionDescription":"Options are granted on the first trading day of each month.

The salary you exchange goes to cover the cost of the options, which is 40% of the exercise price. You could consider  this as the premium you pay to get the right to buy a share at the exercise price. When thinking about the actual value of the options, you want to consider this 40% cost as your initial investment. \n\nIn our example above, we exchanged $80 of our salary to get each option with a $200 exercise price. If we have exchanged $80 of salary for each option to buy a share at $200, our total investment will be $280 per share.\n\nThe stock price would need to go up to at least $280 before we start to make a profit on the salary we exchanged, which means the stock value must appreciate by at least 40% above the exercise price.

Let’s say you receive a coupon to buy an item at $100 until the printed expiration date. You go into the store and see that the retail price is $150. You redeem your coupon and buy it for $100, which saves you $50. In the context of stock options, you might have an option with an exercise price of $100.

The higher the stock price goes above the exercise price, the more your options are worth.\nParticipating in the program is an investment choice that allows you to exchange salary for options. The salary you exchange goes to cover the cost of the options, which is 40% of the exercise price. You could consider  this as the premium you pay to get the right to buy a share at the exercise price. When thinking about the actual value of the options, you want to consider this 40% cost as your initial investment. \n\nIn our example above, we exchanged $80 of our salary to get each option with a $200 exercise price. If we have exchanged $80 of salary for each option to buy a share at $200, our total investment will be $280 per share.\n\nThe stock price would need to go up to at least $280 before we start to make a profit on the salary we exchanged, which means the stock value must appreciate by at least 40% above the exercise price. Continuing our example, let us assume that we exercise and sell our 5 options at $300. If we invested $280 per option and sold at $300, our profit is $20 per option, or $100 total***.\n\n![(5% SOP) (Sell Price - (Option Cost + Exercise Price)) * Number of Options](//images.ctfassets.net/abx5xo923wy6/7aoRJj75et1XNFknt1V0UI/402f86e62e2c17df64e863b1408ad8da/_5-_SOP___Sell_Price_-__Option_Cost___Exercise_Price_____Number_of_Options.png)\n\nThis doesn’t mean that you must wait until the stock price goes up at least 40% before you exercise however.

The higher the stock price goes above the exercise price, the more your options are worth.\nParticipating in the program is an investment choice that allows you to exchange salary for options. The salary you exchange goes to cover the cost of the options, which is 40% of the exercise price. You could consider  this as the premium you pay to get the right to buy a share at the exercise price. When thinking about the actual value of the options, you want to consider this 40% cost as your initial investment. \n\nIn our example above, we exchanged $80 of our salary to get each option with a $200 exercise price. If we have exchanged $80 of salary for each option to buy a share at $200, our total investment will be $280 per share.\n\nThe stock price would need to go up to at least $280 before we start to make a profit on the salary we exchanged, which means the stock value must appreciate by at least 40% above the exercise price. Continuing our example, let us assume that we exercise and sell our 5 options at $300. If we invested $280 per option and sold at $300, our profit is $20 per option, or $100 total***.\n\n![(5% SOP) (Sell Price - (Option Cost + Exercise Price)) * Number of Options](//images.ctfassets.net/abx5xo923wy6/7aoRJj75et1XNFknt1V0UI/402f86e62e2c17df64e863b1408ad8da/_5-_SOP___Sell_Price_-__Option_Cost___Exercise_Price_____Number_of_Options.png)\n\nThis doesn’t mean that you must wait until the stock price goes up at least 40% before you exercise however.

You redeem your coupon and buy it for $100, which saves you $50. In the context of stock options, you might have an option with an exercise price of $100.

You could consider  this as the premium you pay to get the right to buy a share at the exercise price. When thinking about the actual value of the options, you want to consider this 40% cost as your initial investment. \n\nIn our example above, we exchanged $80 of our salary to get each option with a $200 exercise price. If we have exchanged $80 of salary for each option to buy a share at $200, our total investment will be $280 per share.\n\nThe stock price would need to go up to at least $280 before we start to make a profit on the salary we exchanged, which means the stock value must appreciate by at least 40% above the exercise price. Continuing our example, let us assume that we exercise and sell our 5 options at $300.

You redeem your coupon and buy it for $100, which saves you $50. In the context of stock options, you might have an option with an exercise price of $100.

The higher the stock price goes above the exercise price, the more your options are worth.\nParticipating in the program is an investment choice that allows you to exchange salary for options. The salary you exchange goes to cover the cost of the options, which is 40% of the exercise price. You could consider  this as the premium you pay to get the right to buy a share at the exercise price. When thinking about the actual value of the options, you want to consider this 40% cost as your initial investment. \n\nIn our example above, we exchanged $80 of our salary to get each option with a $200 exercise price. If we have exchanged $80 of salary for each option to buy a share at $200, our total investment will be $280 per share.\n\nThe stock price would need to go up to at least $280 before we start to make a profit on the salary we exchanged, which means the stock value must appreciate by at least 40% above the exercise price. Continuing our example, let us assume that we exercise and sell our 5 options at $300.

We’ll divide the monthly contribution by the cost of the option,  then we know how many options you should get for the month.\n\n![(5%) Your Annual Allocation / 12](//images.ctfassets.net/abx5xo923wy6/6nvGrFnyv7rtSH2OIT2EQE/40e04d877cb8c5bb47ca74762506c77f/_5-__Your_Annual_Allocation___12.png)\n\nAs an example, assume the following:\n- Your Annual Allocation: = $12,000 annually or $1,000 monthly\n- Closing Price on the Grant Day: $200\n\nMonthly Calculation:\n![(5% SOP) $1000 / 40% x $200](//images.ctfassets.net/abx5xo923wy6/Nc3FvMKTvwCAWZZbUYyhz/e3051ca4c9ef365725a8e3cd9a7450d7/_5-_SOP___1000___40-_x__200.png)\n\nNow you have 12 options or, in other words, the right to buy 12 shares of Netflix stock at $200.\n\nA couple of points not mentioned above for simplicity's sake:\n- We don’t grant fractional options so we always round down; any remaining amount of allocation is carried over to the next month.\n- When you first join your option allocation is prorated from your hire date.\n"},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"abx5xo923wy6"}},"id":"6LaqHSUAG1Kh5vYR1SkzJA","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2020-08-07T22:28:07.301Z","updatedAt":"2021-01-15T17:23:31.911Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":3,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"sectionContent"}},"locale":"en-US"},"cmsTitle":"SOP \u003e Vest Schedule","sectionTitle":"Vest Schedule","sectionDescription":"Good news!

The higher the stock price goes above the exercise price, the more your options are worth.\nParticipating in the program is an investment choice that allows you to exchange salary for options. The salary you exchange goes to cover the cost of the options, which is 40% of the exercise price. You could consider  this as the premium you pay to get the right to buy a share at the exercise price. When thinking about the actual value of the options, you want to consider this 40% cost as your initial investment. \n\nIn our example above, we exchanged $80 of our salary to get each option with a $200 exercise price. If we have exchanged $80 of salary for each option to buy a share at $200, our total investment will be $280 per share.\n\nThe stock price would need to go up to at least $280 before we start to make a profit on the salary we exchanged, which means the stock value must appreciate by at least 40% above the exercise price. Continuing our example, let us assume that we exercise and sell our 5 options at $300. If we invested $280 per option and sold at $300, our profit is $20 per option, or $100 total***.\n\n![(5% SOP) (Sell Price - (Option Cost + Exercise Price)) * Number of Options](//images.ctfassets.net/abx5xo923wy6/7aoRJj75et1XNFknt1V0UI/402f86e62e2c17df64e863b1408ad8da/_5-_SOP___Sell_Price_-__Option_Cost___Exercise_Price_____Number_of_Options.png)\n\nThis doesn’t mean that you must wait until the stock price goes up at least 40% before you exercise however. You can exercise your options at any point, as long as the stock price is above the exercise price. \n\n***To keep the math simple, the above examples do not include taxes or fees."}]}]}]},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"abx5xo923wy6"}},"id":"46w9gjDywoEgiWaQm48yM6","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-10-24T22:34:26.667Z","updatedAt":"2020-06-24T21:34:21.622Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":31,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"externalTab"}},"locale":"en-US"},"title":"Life Happens","locationBasedContent":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"abx5xo923wy6"}},"id":"7ciucSHsGIIeC8smCAuUa4","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-10-29T19:43:10.448Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-24T21:47:36.378Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":7,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"locationBasedContent"}},"locale":"en-US"},"cmsTitle":"Ext US - Life Happens","location":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"abx5xo923wy6"}},"id":"71tweP9sK440IwCGyUagK0","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2018-07-30T16:29:50.993Z","updatedAt":"2020-11-05T16:33:15.923Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":8,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"locationData"}},"locale":"en-US"},"cmsTitle":"United States","locationName":"United States","flag":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"abx5xo923wy6"}},"id":"3yIeCkVLluimeiYAqUWqEc","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2018-08-21T23:58:07.112Z","updatedAt":"2020-11-05T16:33:13.043Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":7,"locale":"en-US"},"title":"us","url":"//images.ctfassets.net/abx5xo923wy6/3yIeCkVLluimeiYAqUWqEc/c36f12a041ea74cdc04b947c8eca0042/us_flag.svg","details":{"size":6757,"image":{"width":28,"height":20}},"fileName":"us flag.svg","contentType":"image/svg+xml"},"slug":"united-states"},"locationSpecificContent":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"abx5xo923wy6"}},"id":"5Aoh1ebS7jybxWqX8Q71xi","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2020-09-24T21:47:29.052Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-24T21:47:29.052Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"sectionContent"}},"locale":"en-US"},"cmsTitle":"Ext - Global - Life Happens Philosophy ","sectionTitle":"Philosophy","sectionDescription":"When it comes to your life, it’s not our place to decide what things you should care about.
