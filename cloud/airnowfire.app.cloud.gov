                                    Sensor Data Pilot: EPA and USFS are conducting a pilot project to add data from low-cost sensors to the Fire and Smoke map. While these sensors don’t meet the rigorous standards required for regulatory monitors, they can help you get a picture of air quality nearest you especially when wildfire smoke is in your area. Use the map layer icon <i class="fas fa-layer-group"></i> in the upper righthand corner of the map to turn on information from AirNow monitors, USFS temporary monitors, and sensors. EPA and USFS may update the sensor map layer several times during the pilot project, as we respond to feedback and work to improve the map.

                                    <i>U.S. EPA and U.S. Forest Service are conducting a pilot project to add data from air sensors to the Fire and Smoke Map. The data appear as a map layer called Low-Cost Sensors that users can turn off or on as needed. Sensor technology provides thousands of additional particle pollution data points that can be used to supplement the air monitoring stations operated by official air agencies. The sensor data undergoes QA screening, is averaged to hourly values, is corrected for bias, and has the EPA NowCast algorithm applied. This means that the sensor data can use the AQI color scale when it appears alongside the monitoring data that is already on the AirNow Fire and Smoke map. Sensor data is informational only. It will not be used for regulatory purposes.</i>

                                <p><strong>Air Quality (PM<sub>2.5</sub>): </strong>Fine particulate (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) air quality conditions are shown for both monitors (permanent and temporary) as well as low-cost sensors nearest the set location of interest. For monitors and sensors within 30 mi, the closest three monitors and sensors are shown. If no monitors are within 30 mi, the nearest monitor is shown. Click on one of the monitors to see the measurements and conditions at that monitor.</p>
                                <p><strong>Fires: </strong>Local fire conditions indicate whether there is presence of a potential fire within a 150 mile radius of the user defined position (either set through geolocation or manually). Large fire incidents and satellite fire detections are shown. False detections have been known to occur.

                                <hr>
                                <p>The Fire and Smoke Map shows fine particulate (<2.5 micron, PM<sub>2.5</sub>) pollution data obtained from air quality monitors and sensors. Information is shown on both the EPA’s Air Quality Index scale, using the NowCast AQI algorithm, and also as hourly PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration values. For low-cost sensor data, a correction equation is also applied to mitigate bias in the sensor data.</p>
                                <h4>Air Quality Index (AQI), NowCast AQI, and PM<sub>2.5</sub> Concentrations</h4>
                                <hr/>

                                    The AQI is EPA’s index for reporting air quality. It tells you how clean or polluted your air is, and what associated health effects might be a concern for you. The AQI can be calculated for five major air pollutants regulated by the Clean Air Act: ground-level ozone, particle pollution (also known as particulate matter), carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide.  See more information about the <a href="https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/" target="_blank">AQI</a>.

                                    <strong> The AQI used in the Fire and Smoke Map is specifically focused on fine particulate matter (PM) known as PM<sub>2.5</sub>. PM stands for particulate matter (also called particle pollution), the term for a mixture of solid particles and liquid droplets found in the air. PM<sub>2.5</sub> specifically refers to fine inhalable particles, with diameters that are generally 2.5 micrometers and smaller.</strong> See more information about the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/pm-pollution" target="_blank">PM<sub>2.5</sub></a> or the <a href="https://www.airnow.gov/sites/default/files/2019-02/air-quality-guide_pm_2015.pdf" target="_blank">Air Quality Guide for Particle Pollution</a>

                                    It is possible that ozone or PM<sub>10</sub> could drive the local AQI in certain circumstances. To see a map that includes ozone and PM<sub>10</sub> in addition to PM<sub>2.5</sub>, please see the <a href="https://gispub.epa.gov/airnow/" target="_blank" >AirNow Interactive Map</a>.

                                    NowCast refers to an algorithm that is applied to the hourly permanent, temporary, and sensor data when an estimate of the current hourly AQI is needed. The AQI for PM<sub>2.5</sub> is a 24-hour average, so EPA uses an algorithm to estimate the current AQI based on multiple hours of past data. The NowCast uses longer averages during periods of stable air quality and shorter averages when air quality is changing rapidly, such as during a wildfire. However, the NowCast is not designed to react to changes that are shorter than a 3 hr period in duration.

                                <h4>Types of Monitors</h4>
                                <hr/>
                                <strong>Permanent Monitors</strong>
                                <p>
                                    Permanent particulate monitors are owned and maintained by various entities, including: federal, state, tribal, and local agencies. These monitors are regulatory-grade, and the data they produce is of the highest quality.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Most monitors report out hourly. Data for permanent monitors is obtained through the EPA AirNow system which aggregates data feeds from a large number of agencies and organizations on an hourly basis. Data lag in transmission to AirNow is dependent on the specific monitor data transmission methodology and agency involved. Data is retrieved from AirNow every 3 min.
                                </p>
                                <strong>Temporary Monitors</strong>
                                <p>
                                    Temporary, portable particulate monitors are deployed near large, active wildfires by the US Forest Service and state and local agencies. Most monitors report out hourly.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Data for temporary monitors is obtained through the AirSis and the Western Regional Climate Center (WRCC) data feeds. Data is retrieved approximately every 15min, but the monitors themselves only report hourly aggregates based on the clock hour (e.g. 2-3pm). Further transmission lags, particularly with the GOES satellite transmissions processed by the WRCC can sometimes take several hours.
                                </p>
                                <strong>Low-Cost Sensors</strong>
                                <p>
                                    Low-Cost Sensors are portable, generally easier to operate than regulatory-grade monitors, and available on the commercial market. Most sensors report out every few minutes. Most sensors report out every few minutes. Most low-cost sensors do not have data quality that is comparable to the monitoring stations operated by air agencies. For the pilot, sensor data have been averaged to an hour, QA screened, corrected for bias, and NowCast.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Data for low cost sensors is currently obtained through the PurpleAir network with potentially other networks added in the future. The PurpleAir data has undergone QA screening.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    PurpleAir data is collected every 2 min, but only displayed after aggregating to a calendar hour (e.g. 2-3pm) and processing through the correction factor and NowCast AQI algorithm. This processing can take up to 15 min. Additionally, the processing and time smoothing of the hourly aggregation and NowCast algorithm means that the PurpleAir data shown here will not respond as rapidly as the 10 min averages and other shorter term time averages available on the PurpleAir website. Work is ongoing to investigate best to include shorter term time averages or data updates on this map.

                                <strong>Large Fire Incident</strong>
                                <p>
                                    Active large fire incidents from the U.S. National Interagency Fire Center’s active incident feed are presented as fire icons. Clicking on a fire displays information about the fire. Note that these incidents may not have updated for several days due to the nature of the reporting systems used. Additional information on these incidents is available through the Inciweb system (<a href="https://inciweb.nwcg.gov" target="_blank">https://inciweb.nwcg.gov</a>). While the information presented by this feed can be several days old, it does present important management information including the fire name, overall fire size, and containment.

                                <p>
                                    Satellite fire detections are based on information from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) Hazard Mapping System (HMS). This is a combination of automated satellite detected “hotspots” from various satellites and human analyzed fire locations based on smoke plumes. Hotspot detections are based on higher than normal temperatures visible to the satellite from a location on the ground. This represents the detection of above normal temperatures, and does not necessarily reflect the presence of an actual wildland fire, as false detections have been known to occur. Additionally, depending on the satellite the specific location covered by the image pixel may be 1 or more kilometers in resolution. Additionally geolocation error can occur due to other reasons. For large fires, multiple satellite detections may occur for the same fire.

                                    Data is downloaded every 15 minutes from the NOAA Hazard Mapping System (HMS), but HMS updates can sometimes take a few hours to occur.

                                    Smoke plume locations are based on information from the NOAA Hazard Mapping System based on polygons drawn around smoke detected in satellite imagery. In general this represents the presence of smoke in the overall column of air at those locations. However, it may not correspond to smoke being present at ground level; the smoke could be aloft instead. Additionally it will not represent smaller smoke plumes or smoke plumes otherwise not detected by the satellite images (e.g. due to cloud cover, or because they have occurred after the satellite image was taken).

                                    EPA and USFS are conducting a pilot project to add data from low-cost sensors to the Fire and Smoke map. While these sensors don’t meet the rigorous standards required for regulatory monitors, they can help you get a picture of air quality nearest you – especially when wildfire smoke is in your area. Use the map layer icon in the upper righthand corner of the map to turn on information from AirNow monitors, USFS temporary monitors, and sensors. EPA and USFS may update the sensor map layer several times during the pilot project, as we respond to feedback and work to improve the map.

                                        The AirNow sensor data pilot project is designed to provide the public with additional information on levels of particle pollution (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) in the air, particularly during wildfires. The project adds data from low-cost sensors to the Fire and Smoke Map on the AirNow.gov website. This map was developed through a collaborative effort between the U.S. Forest Service (USFS)-led Interagency Wildland Fire Air Quality Response Program and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Map development work was conducted through an agreement with the University of Washington’s School of Environmental and Forest Sciences.

                                        The circles represent the permanent, stationary long-term monitoring stations that are used to report outdoor air quality to the public on AirNow.gov. These are generally operated by state, local or tribal air quality agencies and stay in place for many years. Triangles represent temporarily located monitors (such as EBAMS / ESAMPLERS) that agencies have placed to monitor smoke events. These temporary monitors may come and go as smoke conditions warrant. Squares represent low-cost sensors.

                                        The sensor data comes from PurpleAir, which crowdsources data from that company’s particle pollution sensors and shows the data on a map. Before the sensor data appear on the AirNow Fire and Smoke Map, EPA and USFS apply both a scientific correction equation to mitigate bias in the sensor data, and the NowCast, the algorithm to show the data in the context of the Air Quality Index.

                                        Air sensors, also known as low-cost sensors, are a class of non-regulatory technology for measuring pollutants in the air. This term often describes an integrated set of hardware and software that uses one or more “sensing elements” (also sometimes called sensors) to detect or measure pollutant concentrations. Air sensors are lower in cost, portable, and generally easier to operate than the regulatory monitors widely used in the United States.

                                        Sensor technology provides thousands of additional data points that can be used to supplement data from air monitoring stations operated by official air agencies. USFS and EPA are showing sensor data as part of a pilot project designed to provide the public with additional information that individuals can use to protect their health, particularly during wildfires.

                                                The Fire and Smoke Map allows you to compare current air quality from low-cost sensors, the regulatory grade monitors that report to AirNow, and temporary monitors that USFS, states, tribes and local agencies deploy on fires – and to see all of that information in one place. That’s possible because of the steps EPA and USFS take to mitigate bias in sensor data, apply quality assurance measures and apply the NowCast algorithm to show the data in the context of the Air Quality Index.

                                    <p>
                                        While low-cost sensors are useful for providing general information about air quality, sensor data is not comparable to data from the outdoor air quality monitoring station network operating in the U.S., many of which report to AirNow.  EPA does not use sensor data for regulatory purposes.

                                        EPA scientists have found that air sensors often overestimate or underestimate pollutant concentrations compared to the regulatory-grade instruments that are operated in the same location.  PurpleAir sensors without use of the EPA correction equation measure the same trends in PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations as collocated regulatory monitors and they tend to overestimate the PM<sub>2.5</sub> mass concentrations.

                                        For the sensor data used in the Fire and Smoke Map, EPA has applied a national correction equation, developed by EPA scientists, that mitigates the bias in the sensor data. This corrected data will help provide the public with additional air quality information, especially in areas where there are no regulatory monitors.  When corrected sensor data is used to generate the NowCast AQI, the results are in the right NowCast AQI category 93 percent of the time; the other 7 percent of the time, the results are within one category of the correct NowCast AQI. <a href="https://www.epa.gov/sciencematters/study-explores-ways-improve-accuracy-air-sensors" target="_blank">Read about EPA’s research to improve the accuracy of sensors</a>.

                                        In addition, regulatory air quality monitoring stations are located according to EPA guidelines, remain in one place for many years, are maintained and operated by trained experts, and follow EPA quality assurance protocols.   For most low-cost air sensors, little is known about the locations, including how close sensors are to any sources of pollution. In addition, a lack of information about the maintenance, or operation of these sensors, adds additional uncertainty.

Sensor data is not used on other maps on the AirNow website and is not used to generate the current air quality or forecast AQI shown on the “dial” on the AirNow home page or AirNow app. The data on the map is not used for regulatory purposes.

                                        EPA researchers have used a scientific approach to develop a correction equation for PurpleAir sensors. The PurpleAir sensors were assessed, because their use has grown exponentially, resulting in an extensive network of publicly reporting sensors worldwide. EPA and more than 30 state, local, and tribal air agency partners placed these sensors side-by-side with highly robust and accurate regulatory monitors in more than 70 locations throughout the U.S. to evaluate their performance.

                                        State, local and tribal air agencies are not responsible for the accuracy and performance of the sensor data. The Fire and Smoke Map shows publicly available PM<sub>2.5</sub> (particle pollution) data provided by the PurpleAir data feed. Many PurpleAir sensors are run by community groups and individuals. Little is known about the sensors’ locations, including how close sensors are to any sources of pollution, along with how the sensors are operated or maintained. That’s why you should use the sensor data on the map for informational purposes only.

                                        The sensor data are not meant to be used for official AQI reporting. Although we are quality controlling the data and applying EPA’s correction equation, the data are not comparable to data  from official outdoor air quality monitoring networks. For these reasons, sensor data should only be used to supplement AQI information.

                                        This pilot map is showing only PM<sub>2.5</sub> (particle pollution).

                                        No. For compliance with the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) compliance, instruments, including sensors, must meet the applicable requirements in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) - Part(s) of Title 40, Protection of Environment or other state environmental regulations (see, e.g. 40 CFR Parts 50, 53, and 58). Technical requirements include detailed sampling, siting, and quality assurance requirements. Data from new air sensor instruments should not be used in a regulatory context at this time unless those instruments meet all applicable regulatory requirements.

                                        Most low-cost sensors do not have data quality that is comparable to the monitoring stations operated by air agencies. EPA scientists have found that low-cost sensors often overestimate or underestimate pollutant concentrations compared to the regulatory-grade instruments that are operated in the same location. In addition, studies and data analysis show that PurpleAir sensors typically have a high bias and overestimate PM<sub>2.5</sub> (particle pollution) concentrations. To effectively utilize the mass amounts of sensor data, EPA developed an equation to correct the sensor data to bring it more in line with data from official monitoring stations. The correction equation is based on 50 collocated PurpleAir sensors located in 16 states and included both comparisons with measurements from federally approved monitors (Federal Reference Method and Federal Equivalent Method) at 24-hour averages. <a href="https://www.epa.gov/sciencematters/study-explores-ways-improve-accuracy-air-sensors" target="_blank">Learn more about EPA’s research to improve air sensor accuracy</a>.

                                        The correction equation has been tested on 1-hour averages at concentrations up to 250 micrograms per cubic meter under both typical outdoor air quality conditions as well as during events when smoke is affecting air quality and has reduced bias in both circumstances. The smoke-impacted events include wildfires and prescribed fires in the eastern and western U.S.

                                        Since PurpleAir sensors are biased high, EPA conducted an extensive data analysis with several variables to correct for the bias. The correction equation developed by EPA is:

                                        The correction equation does include a relative humidity (RH) factor, which uses RH data as reported by the PurpleAir sensor itself. If the RH data is not available or invalid (reported RH value is outside of 0-100), a RH value of 50 will be used in the equation.

                                        The RH adjustment to the data is small [a maximum adjustment would be 8 micrograms per cubic meter (μg/m3)]. This adjustment will likely not significantly impact the Air Quality Index that would be reported based on the resulting data. We are working on a future update where we will substitute a 50 percent RH value when RH data is missing from the PurpleAir data feed. This will reduce the potential impact of missing RH data to a maximum of 4 μg/m3

                                        After applying the correction equation, data from PurpleAir sensors represented the correct AQI category 93 percent of the time and within one AQI category all the time. Most of these discrepancies occurred along the breakpoints between AQI categories where small changes in particle pollution (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) mass concentrations shifted the AQI category.

                                        It is possible that there are no publicly available sensors in your area, that the sensors in your area failed to meet the quality control screening criteria developed for this pilot, or that data from sensors is temporarily unavailable. It also is possible that the state, local or tribal agency responsible for air quality in your area is not currently participating in the pilot, meaning sensor data would not show for your area. At the time of the release of the Pilot, only one state has chosen to remove their PurpleAir data from the program.

However, EPA’s quality assurance/quality control process will screen out some poorly performing sensors. Sensors identified by state and local agencies as problematic (such as sensors that are strongly influenced by local pollution sources or sensors that have shown erroneous data for a long time compared to other nearby sensors) may be removed from the pilot. Sensors registered as indoor sensors also have been removed.

                                        As a result, there will always be differences in how sensor data is shown on the two websites. Users can use both websites to learn more about air quality in their area. EPA’s approach allows the Agency to make information from sensors, temporary monitors and permanent AirNow monitors comparable for users of the Fire and Smoke Map.
                                    </p>
                                    <h4>Why does your map show different concentrations for sensors than the PurpleAir website?</h4>
                                    <hr/>
                                    <p>
                                        Under the concentration tab in the pop-up box, you will find adjusted PurpleAir sensor data for the most recent period. This pilot takes two-minute PurpleAir data and aggregates these data into an hourly averaged concentration at the top of every hour. After applying some quality control checks, the EPA national correction equation is then applied to the hour averaged sensor data. These corrected concentration data will not match the data for the same sensor and time period on the PurpleAir website.
                                    </p>
                                    <h4>When will the pilot end?</h4>
                                    <hr/>
                                    <p>
                                        EPA and USFS aim to continually improve the sensor data map layer. The map will undergo several phases of improvements over time, with the goal of having an upgraded version available in time for the 2021 fire season.
                                    </p>
                                    <h4>Will the sensor data be displayed only during fire season?</h4>
                                    <hr/>
                                    <p>
                                        While the pilot is focused on fire season, the sensor map layer will remain available as we work with our state, local and tribal air agency partners to improve this tool.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Based on what we have learned from previous fires, we expect that the sensor data layer will provide valuable air quality information in areas where data from official air quality monitors are not available, especially in the western U.S. In addition, air quality can change rapidly and can vary significantly over geographic areas during fires, and the addition of sensor data can help show those variations.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The sensor map layer can help inform the public about air quality outside of fire season, especially in areas where there are not official air monitoring stations. These gaps in coverage exist year-round.
                                    </p>
                                    <h4>Does the pilot distinguish between government- and community- deployed sensors?</h4>
                                    <hr/>
                                    <p>
                                        Currently, the map does not detail the entity or person responsible for the deployment of the PurpleAir sensors. This type of information is not captured in the public PurpleAir data feed that supplies the information for this website.
                                    </p>
                                    <h4>What are the uncertainties associated with sensor data?</h4>
                                    <hr/>
                                    <p>
                                        Outside of the known high bias of PurpleAir sensor PM<sub>2.5</sub> measurements, there are other uncertainties in sensor data. EPA and USFS cannot know all the details about the crowdsourced PurpleAir sensors. Examples include: whether the sensor was installed properly, whether the sensor was marked incorrectly as outdoors when it is actually located indoors, whether the sensors are periodically checked and cleaned (insects or debris), and how long have they been in the field, among others.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Despite these uncertainties, EPA and USFS find value in this more spatially resolved and higher time resolved crowdsourced data, especially during localized smoke episodes. Experience indicates that data from most crowdsourced sensors will be of value, and a minor fraction may have issues.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Sensor failure is often indicated by the sensor not reporting, or a large disagreement between the two channels on the PurpleAir devices. The EPA and USFS quality control steps compare the data from the A and B channels within the sensors. These steps will likely remove data from failed sensors or those that are influenced by inlet debris or insects.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Working with our state, local and tribal air agency partners, EPA and USFS plan to explore methodologies over the course of this pilot to address uncertainties in order to provide the most robust information possible over the course of this pilot.

                                    <h4>What is the Air Quality Index?</h4>
                                    <hr/>
                                    <p>
                                        The <a href="https://www.airnow.gov/aqi-and-health/" target="_blank">Air Quality Index (AQI)</a> is EPA’s index for reporting air quality. It tells you how clean or polluted your air is, and what associated health effects might be a concern for you.
                                    </p>
                                    <h4>Why is the AQI shown on the Fire and Smoke Map different from other maps?</h4>
                                    <hr/>
                                    <p>
                                        The AQI shown on the Fire and Smoke Map is specifically focused on fine particulate matter, also known as PM<sub>2.5</sub>. It does not include other major air pollutants (i.e. ground-level ozone, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide) that may be measured by your air agency. Please visit the main AirNow interactive map for more AQI information including ozone, PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub>, or your local air agency website, which may have more information and data.
                                    </p>
                                    <h4>What is PM<sub>2.5</sub>?</h4>
                                    <hr/>
                                    <p>
                                        Fine Particulate Matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>, also known as “particle pollution) is inhalable particles with diameters 2.5 microns and smaller. Numerous scientific studies have linked particle pollution exposure to a variety of health problems, including premature death in people with heart or lung disease, nonfatal heart attacks, irregular heartbeat, aggravated asthma, decreased lung function, increased respiratory symptoms such as irritation of the airways, coughing or difficulty breathing.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        People with heart or lung disease, children, and older adults are the most likely to be affected by particle pollution exposure. For more information, visit <a href="https:///www.epa.gov/pm" target="_blank">https:///www.epa.gov/pm</a>

                                    <p>
                                        The NowCast is the algorithm that EPA uses to relate hourly readings from air quality monitors to the U.S. Air Quality Index (AQI). EPA uses the NowCast to show you current air quality using the AQI colors and scale (the AQI for particle pollution is a 24-hour index). The NowCast for particle pollution shows you air quality for the most current hour available by using a calculation that involves multiple hours of past data. It uses longer averages during periods of stable air quality and shorter averages when air quality is changing rapidly, such as during a wildfire.
                                    </p>
                                    <h4>What is the difference between the NowCast AQI and the hourly PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration?</h4>

The NowCast uses longer averages during periods of stable air quality and shorter averages when air quality is changing rapidly, such as during a wildfire. The PM<sub>2.5</sub> value is a 1-hour average concentration measured by an air quality monitor.

                                    <h4>How are fire and smoke plumes detected in my area?</h4>
                                    <hr/>
                                    <p>
                                        Fire and smoke plume detections are from the NOAA’s Hazard Mapping System Fire and Smoke Products. Trained analysts manually integrate data from various automated fire detection algorithms with information from satellite instruments, including NASA’s Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) Imager, NOAA’s Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and NASA’s Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The analyst outlines smoke plumes that are detected by the satellites, resulting in a quality-controlled display of fire locations and smoke plumes. The smoke plumes are updated every few hours.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Both the fire detections and the smoke plume data generated by the Hazard Mapping System note that the information on fire position should be used as general guidance and for strategic planning, not for tactical decisions, such as the activation of a response to fight these fires and evacuation efforts, without other information to corroborate the fire's existence and location.

                                        The Interagency Wildland Fire Air Quality Response Programs provides Air Resource Advisors (ARAs) that work with Incident Management Teams responding to large wildfires.  Most large and persistent wildfires have ARAs assigned. ARAs analyze, summarize, and communicate smoke impacts to incident management teams, air quality regulators, public health agencies and the public. ARAs issue these Special Smoke Statements (also known as Smoke Outlooks) for areas where smoke from wildfires may be of concern and they have been deployed. At this time, only Special Smoke Statements issued by ARAs are provided in the map however further information on smoke impacts can be available at your state, tribal or local air quality agency and the Pilot is assessing how to include such information in the map environment.
