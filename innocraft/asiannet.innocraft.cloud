When configured, data will be tracked into this form only when the form is viewed on a page that matches any of criteria configured below. This is useful when you want to track data for your form only on some of your website pages.

A form may be submitted several times when a visitor has to correct form validation errors. To track a form conversion, you can configure one or several pages and as soon as a visitor visits a page that matches any of the criteria below, the form will be converted and a form conversion will be tracked.","FormAnalytics_FormSetupConversionRulesHelp2":"For example you might redirect a visitor to a page \"http:\/\/example.com\/signup-success.html\" when the form is submitted successfully.
