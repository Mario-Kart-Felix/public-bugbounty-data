	<h2 class="title">anyInventory 2.0 Released</h2>
	<span class="date">March 19, 2005</span>
	<div class="body">
		<p>anyInventory has been rewritten using the PEAR DB abstraction layer in order to add support for Oracle (oci8) databases. XML export support has been removed, but the barcode/label system has seen a tremendous upgrade thanks to user Steven Ball.</p>
		<p>The storage for uploaded files has been moved to the database rather than the item_files folder in order to simplify the installation, and all bugs submitted into the SourceForge bug tracker have been fixed.</p>
		<p>Any users of previous versions of anyInventory with access to PEAR are encouraged to upgrade.</p>

	<h2 class="title">anyInventory 1.9.1 Released</h2>
	<span class="date">August 17, 2004</span>
	<div class="body">
		<p>Version 1.9.1 of anyInventory has been released. This version contains fixes for several serious bugs present in 1.9, some of which made the application unusable for some people. Users of any previous versions are strongly encouraged to upgrade.</p>
		<p>The code for deletion of files, items, and categories has been completely re-written, which should solve the problem of orphaned files and items. Also, all of the patches listed on the SourceForge patch page have been incorporated as well.</p>
		<p>Two new features are present in 1.9.1:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Label sheets. You can now generate labels from anyInventory that are ready to print on five different commonly used label sheets. Future versions will allow you to specify your own dimensions for the sheet.</li>
			<li>Table view vs. list view. You can now view items in either a list view, which has been the default in all previous releases, or a table view, much like a spreadsheet. This option can be toggled on each category page.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>A German translation has been added, so anyInventory is now available in English, Spanish, French, and German. There is no German documentation; if you would be willing to translate, contact chris@efinke.com.</p>

	<h2 class="title">anyInventory 1.8 Released</h2>
	<span class="date">July 10, 2004</span>
	<div class="body">
		<p>This is our biggest release yet, with over a week since 1.7.1 was released.  An entirely new user system has been added, allowing for the password-protection of the administration side as well as the entire inventory.</p>
		<p>The quick-search on each page has been brought back to replace the advanced search, which is undergoing a re-write.   </p>
		<p>Also added is the auto-incrementing field, which keeps track of a unique id number for each item in the inventory.  This field name, as well as the text on the front page and the "Name" field label can now be customized in the administration section.</p>
		<p>Another new feature is the addition of more information in the item lisiting in each category.  Now, the first few fields for each item are shown after the item name with their values, allowing for quicker finding of the item you want to view.</p>
		<p>Field dividers have been added as well, allowing you to separate groups of fields into logical divisions.</p>
		<p>Users of any previous version are strongly encouraged to upgrade to 1.8, as many bugs have been fixed since the release of 1.7.1.</p>
