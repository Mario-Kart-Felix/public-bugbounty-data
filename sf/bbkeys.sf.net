              ok people... i have done something that should be well received... 
              <br>
              <br>
              i have made 0.60.0-alpha available... take a look at http://blackbox.alug.org/alpha.html 
              before even *thinking* about downloading it... this is NOT A FULL 
              BLOWN RELEASE... this is just a snapshot of my current source tree... 
              and will change frequently <br>
              <br>
              read alpha.html twice... then read it again... once you understand 
              that this is *alpha* software... download it and play with it... 
              also... i have made Jason Kasper's bbkeys slitapp available as well... 
              read the docs on how to configure the little jewel... <br>
              regards :) <br>

    <p class="entrytext">Confused? =:) Prior to this above posting from Brad, 
      blackbox handled its own keybindings. Brad and I worked together for the 
      few months prior to this alpha release on pulling out all the keybindings 
      for blackbox and allowing an external application to handle them for it. 
      I wrote bbkeys--the application that does just that.</p>
    <p class="entrytext">Originally, bbkeys was a very simple C program with less 
      than 100 lines of code. But I decided that it might be of some value to 
      the blackbox user if they would have an icon of some sort on their screen 
      that they could use to launch the configuration program of their choice 
      to configure their keybindings in blackbox. Thus, I rewrote bbkeys inside 
      the framework of John Kennis's bbtools. Kennis has written numerous other 
      programs for blackbox, including bbpager, bbmail, bbppp, bbdate, and others. 
      His work can be found <a href="http://bbtools.thelinuxcommunity.org/">here</a>. 
    </p>
    <p><span class="entrytext">bbkeys has grown tremendously in functionality 
      since I first wrote it. During 2001, Ben 'xOr' Jansens started helping me 
      with bbkeys. His contributions include the stacked cycling code that bbkeys 
      now offers--a much better window-cycling mechanism--as well as the menuing 
      code that bbkeys uses to show its user a list of open windows to cycle through. 
      Thanks to patches and contributions from around the world, bbkeys now allows 
      blackbox to rival the key-driven functionality of the other window managers. 
      Almost anything you want to do with windows in blackbox can be done through 
      bbkeys interfacing with blackbox.</span></p>
    <p><span class="entrytext">Now, bbkeys is just one example of what having 
      an external-to-the-window-manager program handling keybindings can be like. 
      Another extremely well-written keygrabber for blackbox is the epistrophy 
      code that Scott 'woodblock' Moynes has written. Having keybindings managed 
      outside of the window manager has meant that even though blackbox development 
      has stopped for over a year, the keyboard interface to blackbox has grown 
      and developed in exciting ways. The future remains to be seen for this, 
      though. Sean 'shaleh' Perry has taken over development for blackbox and 
      it will be his call as to what happens with keybindings and blackbox.</span><br>

        You have probably heard this before, but there is one thing I miss in bbkeys. That is a proper window cycling keybinding. I know you have window next and last. But I often have 5-6 windows in a workspace, but most of the time I only use 2-3 of them. It's very annoying to have to cycle throug all other windows that I don't use to swap between 2 windows. I know I can use the "prev window", but then I need to bind another key. <br><br> The best thing would be to have a cycle windows keybinding that works the same way as the one in sawfish. The windows aren't cycled through sequentially, but instead the most recent window comes first.<br><br> Best regards<br> Vidar Breivik
