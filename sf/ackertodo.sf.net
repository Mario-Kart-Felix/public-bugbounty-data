		  <h3>September 26th, 2006</h3>
                  <p class="last">Don't ask me what caused it, but all the sudden I've been back on an ackerTodo kick fixes bugs and improving things all over the place (mainly the Task List). Usually I list all of the changes (or at least most) for new releases here, but because there were so many I'm going to have to redirect you to the <a herf="changelog.html">ChangeLog</a> instead. There you will see the major changes outlined plus there were some other more minor tweaks that I didn't mention. So, with that being said, head on over to SourceForge and download <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=104707&package_id=112659&release_id=450882">ackerTodo v4.2</a>!</p>
		
		  <h3>September 6th, 2006</h3>
		  <p class="last">Last week I decided to finally tackle adding the support for table prefixes (thanks grima), and once I had that in there I figured I had enough bug fixes and other things to finally have another release. To see all of the real details of the changes in this release check out the <a href="http://ackertodo.sourceforge.net/site2/changelog.html">changelog</a>. As usual, comments and suggestions are always welcome so <a href="mailto:hensleyrob@gmail.com">bring 'em on</a>!</p>

		  <h3>June 13th, 2006</h3>
		  <p class="last">First off, it's been awhile. Let's see, what all has happend since the last release? Well, I've finally graduated, other than that not much at all. With this release of ackerTodo v3.8 today, I bring you a huge fix for a problem, if you haven't noticed yet, you'll notice in about six months or less. I had hard coded the years drop down box and never got around to fixing it until someone reminded me the other day (see, I really do read those bug reports/feature requests)! I've also added a fix, or at least it has for me, to try and stop page jumping in the task list with Ajax enabled. I've also added a Russian language file thanks to a generous user. Hope you all enjoy this release and if you have problems don't be afraid to email me at <a href="mailto:hensleyrob@gmail.com">hensleyrob@gmail.com</a>.</p>

		  <h3>February 16th, 2006</h3>
                  <p class="last">It's been awhile since I've released anything or made any really drastic changes, so today I decided why not change that. You can now get ackerTodo v3.6 featuring a few MySQL 5.x fixes, an export feature (subject to change) and a few other bug fixes. Another why I decided to relase today was because I've been really busy lately with my last semester at <a href="http://www.nku.edu">NKU</a> so I might not have much time to devote to ackerTodo for a little while, that is. Don't take this as the project is dead so you quit sending cmoments/suggestions to me, because I still want that and things will get added in due time, don't worry. If you have any questions or comments about this release or the state of the project, please feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:hensleyrob@gmail.com">hensleyrob@gmail.com</a>.</p>

		  <h3>December 29th, 2005</h3>
		  <p class="last">Today I bring you ackerTodo v3.4! I've added a lot to the main task list as I'm sure you'll see after upgrading. You can now update the due date (for tasks with a due date), expand/collapse rows in the task list to display the task description or any comments for it (then edit/delete those comments) all from the main task list. I've also made the AJAX parts of ackerTodo optional, they can be disabled in the user settings section. Hope you all enjoy this release as much as I did learning AJAX with it. Any problems, comments or suggestions send them to <a href="mailto:hensleyrob@gmail.com">hensleyrob@gmail.com</a>.</p>

		  <h3>November 15th, 2005</h3>
                  <p class="last">I recently checked to see how many downloads ackerTodo has had since it's creation and just today we've passed the <b>5,000th download mark!</b> With that in mind having not released anything for awhile, I decided to release ackerTodo v3.2. This release includes the ability to delete global categories, a few more strings separated out of tasks.inc, and a change to the Quick Add feature to make tasks Open-Ended instead of Daily by default. It's a rather simple release but there were a few fixes I thought needed to get out there so, now they are.</p>

		  <h3>September 5th, 2005</h3>
                  <p class="last">Lately I've been on an ackerTodo kick trying to add what I can where I can and get things cleaned up as much as possible for another relase. Hopefully it's to that point because today I released ackerTodo v3.0. With it comes a new theme (softblue1), some hardening by David Coallier, Global Categories, and some AJAX/JS improvements/effects. If you have any problems or suggestions (like where I can add more AJAX/JS), just send them off to <a href="mailto:hensleyrob@gmail.com">hensleyrob@gmail.com</a>.</p>

                  <h3>July 18th, 2005</h3>
                  <p class="last">It's been quite awhile since the last release and a few bugs have been addressed since then, so I decided why not release a new version. ackerTodo v2.8 includes a few updated language files and bug fixes for a small issue with groups and standardizing the remove category stuff. That's about, enjoy!</p>
                  
                  <h3>June 15th, 2005</h3>
                  <p class="last">With today being my birthday and all, I've decided to keep the tradition alive and release another version of ackerTodo. ackerTodo v2.6 comes with it a favicon.ico, access keys (see README), yearly tasks, a new theme by Matti J. Kï¿½rki called washedout, and the ability to set a default view of the task list. I've also cleaned up the Upload module a bit, updated the cmd.php, reworked the layout of the task list when viewing everyone's tasks, and a few other cosmetic fixes here and there. Send feedback as usual, and keep translating and themeing!</p>
                  
                  <h3>June 8th, 2005</h3>
                  <p class="last">Lately I've started taking a look at packaging ackerTodo in both .deb and .rpm packages. I first stared with <a href="http://www.debian.org">Debian</a> packaging and was a bit overwhelmed. If anyone out there is an expierience packager in either of those formats, please email me and let me know if you'd like to help out. I hope to try and get ackerTodo into the Debian package repository sometime in the future but I think I'm going to need some help.</p>
                  
<!--                  <h3>June 6th, 2005</h3>
                  <p class="last">I will admit, ackerTodo v2.2 had a few too many bugs for my liking and I apologies to the users out there. I've now released ackerTodo v2.4 with a lot of bug fixes, Open-Ended tasks, Email Notification as a module (which also emails you if someone assigns a task to you), optimized the task list to not query EVERY task, cleaned up the Weekly and Monthly tasks, added a Print View to the view_task.html, and many many more fixes/improvements (please read the CHANGELOG for more info). Another thing I did was removed 40 unused strings from the english.inc language file, so if you maintain a language file, if you don't mine cleaning it up a bit, that'd be great! Hope you enjoy this release more then the last, email me if you have any problems at <a href="mailto:hensleyrob@nku.edu">hensleyrob@nku.edu</a>.</p> -->
                  
                  <h3>May 25th, 2005</h3>
                  <p class="last">ackerTodo v2.2, which I released today, includes quite a few new things. To start things off it now has a Dutch language file thanks to Joost Schevers. I've also added the ability to edit comments per request of a few users. But probably the most requested and biggest change for this release was the implementation of recurring tasks. You can now have tasks set to Daily, Weekly, Monthly, or No Recurrence. Due to this new feature, I did have to make a database change, please read the UPGRADE file for the change (all it is is renaming a field in the tasks table). There are also a few other minor adjustments and bugfixes here and there.</p>
                  
						<h3>February 21st, 2005</h3>
						<p class="last">It has been brought to my attention by Richard Turner, that in the March issue of <a href="http://www.linuxformat.co.uk/">Linux Format</a> there's an article featuring ackerTodo! This of course is great news for the project and especially me. I just want to thank all of you out there who use ackerTodo and have made it what it is today, keep spreading the word! You can see the article here (<a href="../img/linuxformat.jpg">Low Res</a> or <a href="../img/linuxformat_hires.jpg">Hi Res</a>). It's not the highest quality, but it does the job.</p>

<!--
						<h3>Feb 4th, 2005</h3>
                  <p>Today I released ackerTodo v1.60, which fixes all of the currently open bugs. In this release you'll find a new CLI interface in the scripts directory, which is somewhat of a frontend to ackerTodo. I plan on working on this frontend to make it more robust and support everything the web interface does, to an extent. Another thing you'll notice in this release it a lot more language files then before. The problem is, they're not all complte. If anyone out there can translate to another language, please do so and send the .inc file to <a href="mailto:hensleyrob@nku.edu">hensleyrob@nku.edu</a>.</p>
