<P STYLE="text-align: justify">
<B>AMake 2.10.20</B> is a file maker tool of its own. It also supports
modes to be compatible to <I>GNUmake</I>, <I>smake</I> and <I>pmake</I>
by <I>SGI</I>, <I>smake</I> by <I>Joerg Shilling</I>, SUN make,
WatcomMake, and the POSIX make (called ANSII by
mistake). All of that to the best of my knowledge.
It has no <I>BSD make</I> compatible mode, however it will compile
under FreeBSD as well.

	Why another file maker tool?
</H4></UL></P>

<P>
<B>AMake 2.10.20</B> wasn't created to replace any file maker, I started on this
project because I didn't have any file maker on my <I>Amiga</I>. Only later
<I>GNUmake</I> became available and worked pretty well.
</P>

<A NAME="use">
<P><UL><H4 STYLE="color: #775511">
	Why use AMake 2.10.20?
</H4></UL></P>

<P>
The result is a file maker which includes many options (some of which
are redondant) so it can be made compatible to many other file makers.
Many of the options come from other file makers. However, a large number are specific
to <B>AMake 2.10.20</B>. These offer a way to create incredibly small makefile scripts; scripts
that are more powerful than script written for any other make tool.
Two among the strongest are the extended
<B>AMake 2.10.20</B> patterns and the very large amount of special targets (or flags).
The pattern rules and preprocessors are available in many other file
maker. <B>AMake 2.10.20</B> integrates many preprocessor options to enable system
specific selections and to ease debugging (just check out the #echo command and
enjoy the easiness with which you can check what you have in a variable without
printing 1000+ pages of unreadable output first!).
</P>

<P>
A quick <A HREF="amake-options.html">reference of options</A> is available for
those who want to know more about <B>AMake 2.10.20</B> before to download the
complete software.

At this time, you can download a version which will compile under Linux,
MS-DOS, and IRIX. It should also compile under SunOS and FreeBSD with
minor changes. <B>AMake 2.10.20</B> was written in ANSII C and
