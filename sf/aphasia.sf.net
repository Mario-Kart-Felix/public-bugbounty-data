<p>Aphasia is an advanced scripting language for the web. It features a
type-safe core, C++ modules with signatures, an optimizing "compiler",
higher-order functions, built-in database support, garbage collection, and
more. 

<p>Aphasia uses FastCGI to talk to an apache web server, and only
cooperates with mySQL.  The compiler is written in <b><a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_ML">Standard ML</a></b>.
Because of these dependencies, installation is pretty complicated.  I
don't recommend installing it unless you're really interested in
development. I've only ever compiled it on linux, but it would
probably work on other systems with apache/fastcgi/mysql with a little
tweaking.  Plans for the future include streamlining the installation
procedure and removing as many dependencies as possible.

<p>There are two versions of Aphasia.  First was a prototype that is
about 6 years old ("<b><a
href="http://aphasia.cvs.sourceforge.net/aphasia/aphasia-proto1/">Aphasia
1 Prototype</a></b>"). Many applications were written for Aphasia 1,
but it is now deprecated.  As of 31 Dec 2005, <b><a
href="http://aphasia.cvs.sourceforge.net/aphasia/aphasia2/">Aphasia
2</a></b> is the preferred version of the language.  It is
"sideways-compatible" with Aphasia 1 code, so that applications can be
ported in a piecemeal fashion (also, both versions still use the
Aphasia 1 apache plugin).  Aphasia 2 syntax closely resembles Standard
ML.


<p>Please see <b><a
href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/aphasia/">CVS</a></b>
for code. For examples of sites built with aphasia, see <b><a
href=http://spacebar.org/>spacebar</a></b> and <b><a
href=http://snoot.org/>snoot.org</a></b>. If you'd like to get
involved with the project, please <b><a
