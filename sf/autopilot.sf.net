<h3>Latest news:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Drupal Broke, so we've moved back to the "old" website for now.
(20 Dec 2005)

	<li>Successful navigation tests:  When the autopilot was engaged,
the cyclic stick became an absolute north/south position with 10 meters of
authority in each direction.
<a href="images/nova_proto/command.1.png">Test 1</a>,
<a href="images/nova_proto/command.2.png">test 2</a>
and
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=5438268">interpretation of the data</a>.

	<li><b>IT WORKS!</b>  The system hovered Dennis' Nova for several
tanks of fuel, holding a position with full authority on the cyclic and
tail rotor.  You can see it
<a href="images/nova_proto/bench.jpg">on the bench</a>
and
<a href="images/nova_proto/handsoff.jpg">in hands-off flight</a>.
There is also a

<h3>What's going on here?</h3>
We're building a system for autonomous aerial vehicles for the
hobbiest.  The entire design and all software is available as
Free Software, licensed under the GPL.  The goal is to produce
a do-it-yourself <a href="http://www.rotomotion.com/prd_IMP.html">autopilot kit</a> that anyone can build and fly.

<p>
Our initial target is 60 sized model helicopters and less than
$500 in parts.  So far we've been very successful -- one of our
2.2 boards has hovered a Concept 60 for several minutes at a time
under attitude command from the safety pilot.
It isn't totally autonomous yet, but the demonstration has proven
that the inertial measurement unit (IMU) and Kalman filter approach
work well.
