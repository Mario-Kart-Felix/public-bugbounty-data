		<h1>About</h1>
		<p>
			This Ada-binding to OpenGL aims at providing the latest OpenGL
			features in a collection of Ada packages. It also supports the
			major OpenGL support libraries such as GLU, GLUT and GLFW.<br>
		</p>
		<h1>News</h1>

		<dl>
			<dt> 2003-08-12 </dt>
				<dd> It was about time to release 0.12. I have been putting it off
					for a while now hoping that someone would test the WGL binding, but so
					far that has not happened.<br>
					0.12 includes bindings to GLFW and WGL and the GNAE support has been
					fixed as it was broken in 0.10. Also, 0.12 no longer requires a
					patched AdaBindX to work.
					It's on the <a href="downloads.php">downloads</a>
					page.

			<dt> 2003-06-27 </dt>
				<dd> I accidentally forgot to add the AdaBindX patch to the 0.10
					release so if you want to use it with X11 support you have
					to fetch the patch from AdaOpenGL 0.9.<br>
					I'm working on the next release which I expect to be out
					shortly. It will no longer require a patched AdaBindX, it will
					include support for WGL and
					<a href="http://glfw.sourceforge.net/">GLFW</a> and I have
					updated the opengl, glX and glext bindings to the latest
					versions available. There are also some more style corrections,
					mainly in glext and glX which should now compile without warnings
					with '-gnaty'.<br>
					The WGL and GLFW bindings are already in CVS if you want to try them
					out. The WGL binding is currently being verified by one of my users
					and I will probably whip up some minor GLFW demo some day soon to
					test that binding. After both are verified I will release a new
					version.<br>
					At this point there are only two things left on my todo list for
					1.0, and they are an AGL-binding and make sure everything compiles
					with '-gnaty' (I don't think all of the examples do at the moment).
					I should also design some better documentation, although this is a
					boring task.

				<dd> AdaOpenGL 0.10 is out, grab it from the
					<a href="downloads.php">downloads</a> page.<br>
					This is a minor update which mainly constitutes of a
					gazillion style fixes, an install target in the Makefile
					and compilation of a dynamic library.<br>
					I have run this version on MacOS X and it is working
					just fine, what is missing though is a binding to AGL and
					I still haven't gotten round to fixing a WGL binding.<br>
					At the moment I am working on a project where I will be
					using this binding a lot so hopefully I will be forced to
					create those two last bindings in the near future =).
					I consider AGL, WGL and final style fixes the three tasks
					left before I go 1.0 so we are getting close already.

			<dt> 2003-03-24 </dt>
				<dd> Long time, no update. I've been very busy at school, but
					I haven't forgotten about this project yet.<br>
					As my school project is coming up, and it uses Ada and
					OpenGL I'm hoping to clean some stuff up here real soon.
					<br>
					In the meantime you can admire the new screenshot of
					AdaGLUT running on MacOS X 10.2.4 in Apple's X11. I'm
					hoping to be able to write a carbonized example in the
					near future for all you OSX-lovers out there.

			<dt> 2003-01-11 </dt>
				<dd> Finally I have released AdaOpenGL 0.9 which I would like
					to consider the first stable release.<br>
					I have not had time to extensively test it but the tests
					I have performed tells me it's working satisfactory.<br>
					You can get it from the
					<a href="downloads.php">downloads</a> page.<br>
					These versions are supported:<br>
					OpenGL: 1.4<br>
					GLU: 1.3<br>
					glut: 3.7<br>
					glX: 1.4<br>
					<br>
					<b>New features:</b>
					<ul>
						<li>glut support</li>
						<li>Replaced all uses of "access GL*" in
							function/procedure declarations with GL*Ptr
							types</li>
						<li>Added glut example</li>
						<li>Added SDL example</li>
					</ul>
				<br>
					<b>Bugfixes:</b>
					<ul>
						<li>You can now pass Ada null's to gl* functions (that
							support it)</li>
						<li>Removed unnecessary overloaded functions that used
							System.Address since you can use 'Unchecked_Access
							to pass an aliased variable as a pointer</li>
						<li>Stronger typing</li>
						<li>glX fixed, requires a patched AdaBindX 0.7.2, or a
							newer version (not available at the moment)</li>
						<li>glX example now working</li>
						<li>Alot of sourcecode cleanups</li>
					</ul>

			<dt> 2003-01-08 </dt>
				<dd> Guillaume Foliard found the glX problem and sent in a
					a patch that adds two missing features to AdaBindX which
					are needed to use glX. The patch has been sent to the
					AdaBindX developers and we hope that it will be included
					in the next release.<br>
					In the meantime the patch can be downloaded here:
					<a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=664228&amp;group_id=70196&amp;atid=526925">AdaBindX 0.7.2 Patch</a><br>
					Since this was the final major bug with the current CVS
					version of AdaOpenGL I hope that I will be able to release
					the next version within the next day or two. There are
					some minor bugs left in the examples that I want to fix
					first and I have to study for my exams (therefore the
					delay).

			<dt> 2003-01-04 </dt>
				<dd> OpenGL.GLUT is up and running. OpenGL and OpenGL.GLU seems
					to behaving as they should, so the next release is closing
					in fast. The only thing that is not working as I want it
					to is OpenGL.GLX. Passing a NULL to glXCreateContext as
					the sharedList parameter causes an exception to be
					raised even though this is how you use it in C, I must've
					misunderstood some vital Ada part relating to interfacing
					C libs. I have added a screenshot of GLUT running one of
					the NeHe tutorials in fullscreen.<br>
					I'm working on the thick binding and it is progressing
					nicely. There will probably be a prototype available real
					soon.<br>
					As I have three exams starting next saturday and after
					that I'm back to school I'm in a hurry to finish as much
					as possible this week since I don't know how much time I
					will have available in two weeks.

			<dt> 2002-12-31 </dt>
				<dd> I have added a documentation section. Most of the docs are
					generated by AdaDoc so they might not be very informative.
					Hopefully I will get some more comments into those files
					which will make the docs more human readable.<br>
					I've also restructured some of the function calls in CVS
					thanks to some hints from Joachim Schr√∂er. I've begun
					working on GLUT, but it's not ready for use just yet.

			<dt> 2002-12-28 </dt>
				<dd> I have uploaded <a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/adaopengl/adaopengl-0.1.tar.gz?download">adaopengl-0.1.tar.gz</a>.<br>
					This release is meant to be used for evaluation and
					feedback. It is likely the API will change somewhat in the
					near future to provide a thicker binding. The standard
					OpenGL API will always be there though.<br><br>

					This is the first post.<br>
					There is not much here yet except that css and iconset
					that I stole ;).<br>
					There is a somewhat useful version of AdaOpenGL in cvs. If
					you have anything constructive to say about it please mail
					me or use the mailinglist provided by sourceforge.
