    <h2><a name="Whatitdoes"></a> What the Access Server Does</h2>
    Access Server is a suite of programs that does a couple of
    things: 

    <ul>
      <li>It is an "access/terminal server" which connects incoming
      modem connections to remote TCP sockets. <em>Scenario:</em>
      An ISP has a bank of modems attached to a PC with a
      multi-port serial card. A caller connects to one of the
      modems. The Access Server registers the call, allows the
      modem to answer and connects the modem to a remote Radius
      Authentication application. All this time, a manager is able
      to see a GUI representation of the call load, which modems
      are busy and how many failed connections were registered in
      the last hour.</li>

      <li>It is a testbed for a VoIP (Voice-over-IP) system that
      uses the voice recording and playback features of current
      voice modems</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><a name="Requirements"></a>Requirements</h3>

    <p>The idea is to develop a gateway between telephone networks
    and IP networks. It should:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Be like an appliance - put the disk in, switch on the
      computer, forget!</li>

      <li>It should be simple and act sensibly when things go wrong
      (e.g. power cuts)</li>

      <li>Run on low-end hardware.</li>

      <li>It should be possible to use it as a gateway to things
      other than just the PPP protocol.</li>

      <li>Configuration and management must be possible from a a
      remote location.</li>

      <li>When one is trying to get one of these servers running
      one needs an interface with which it is easy to make
      changes.</li>

      <li>It's always very important to keep a check on how well it
      is running so the management program's user interface should
      present the vital information simply and quickly.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The Access Server Project addresses these requirements by
    the following means:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>It offers a web management interface via a tiny embedded
      web server. This allows the status of individual modems to be
      viewed from a web browser as well as permitting modems to be
      enabled and disabled, or reset etc.</li>

      <li>It runs on linux, and is booted off a single floppy disk.
      It configures itself and automatically finds available modems
      - this is useful in the case of power failure as it will
      simply reload and carry on working when power returns.</li>

      <li>Installation is as simple as editing a small config file
      on the floppy disk to specify an IP address for the machine
      and for the remote TCP service, inserting the disk into a
      computer and powering on.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Please ask questions so I can think of more to write!</p>

    <h2><a name="History"></a>History</h2>

    <p>I started writing Access Server to scratch an itch.&nbsp; My
    office used a Xyplex(TM) Access Server 720.&nbsp; We were
    running a dial-in service using a proprietary protocol.&nbsp;
    The modem rack had 4 modems and there was no chance of buying
    any more since the company that made it was sold and the model
    discontinued.</p>

    <p>I spent a long time trying to work out how to attach a plain
    old external modem to the Access server as a quick fix. I'm
    from Zimbabwe and we don't buy new things like modem racks here
    without a more than excellent reason.</p>

    <p>Anyhow the experience was miserable.&nbsp; The 720 has an
    extremely arcane command language,&nbsp; some commands activate
    immediate changes while some activate delayed changes and it's
    very hard to know which is which.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Our server ran a program which received the raw data from
    the incoming modem (via a TCP socket).&nbsp; This program was
    responsible for managing the proprietary protocol that the
    caller spoke.</p>

    <p>Simply setting the port to make a raw (untranslated and
    unfiltered) connection to a remote port was hard even though I
    copied the 720 port config from one of the existing modems to
    the port of the new external modem.</p>

    <h2><a name="Scratching_the_itch"></a>Scratching the Itch</h2>
    To cut the story short, I decided that this was a terrible
    waste of time. So I decided to write an Access Server myself
    like so: 

    <ol>
      <li>Wrote it in Linux - reliable, customisable.</li>

      <li>It boots from a floppy disk which makes everything
      simpler for Windoze types because they don't have to install
      anything. In addition it can run on machines without hard
      drives like the old bit of junk in the corner that nobody can
      find a use for.</li>

      <li>Uses static linking and cram all the functionality into a
      single executable which runs as the init process - this saves
      one from the pain of stripping down the C library to fit on a
      compressed ramdisk image. It means that you can use the same
      C library as you use normally on your Linux machine.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2><a name="Some_Other_Applications"></a>Some Other
    Applications</h2>
    Well, first problems first for me but some interesting
    alternative uses for an Access Server of this type have popped
    into mind. 

    <p>There is, of course, the standard kind of thing where the
    access server runs pppd for every incoming connection.&nbsp;
    This could be done by Access Server as well.&nbsp; It's
    modem-autodetection feature and remote management features
    (when they are written) could make it a worthwhile alternative
    to the many other getty's out there.</p>

    <p>Then the other area that I'd like to explore is VOIP.&nbsp;
    Currently lots of people have voice-modems.&nbsp; I'd like to
    explore the possibility of setting up a few of these as "input"
    points from the Plain Old Telephone System (POTS), transferring
    the information via the internet to an "output" point.</p>

    <p>VOIP is a magic thing for people in the third world.&nbsp;
    Overseas telephone calls can be ruinously expensive, but
    businesses everywhere need to make them every day -
    particularly those with export/import focus. &nbsp; People
    could use products like Netmeeting but these require a computer
    with an internet connection and they're a pain to learn to
    operate and the person you're trying to contact has to have the
    same thing.&nbsp; It would be much simpler if people could use
    just their telephone to do it.</p>

    <p>Of course this has been done already but it's not ubiqitous
    yet and the cost is not all that low.</p>

    <p>Anyhow we'll see.&nbsp; I'm having a lot of trouble
    interpreting the formats that my USR Sportster Voice
    records.</p>
