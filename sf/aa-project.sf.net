<H1>Three goals of AA-Project:</H1>
</center>

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

Port all important software (like Doom, Second Reality, X windows etc..) 
on AA-lib.
<LI>

Port AA-lib on all available platforms (mainly ZX-Spectrum and Sharp).
<LI>

Force IBM to start manufacturing MDA cards again.
</OL>

<P>
AA-project was started by Jan Hubicka. In that times just a few people knew about
it. Then a new demo named BB has been relased to show the power 
of AA-lib technology. Now the project is freely available and anyone can help.

Well is just because you use wrong software. There is just one truth web browser - Lynx.

<H1>History of AA-project</H1>
</center>
<P>
Once upon a time we've (my friend Kamil and I) bought two old Herculeses
as secondary monitors. We didn't know for that time that our Diamond
Stealths 64 cards would become obsolete soon. The next day we downloaded
the logo of Linux Texas Users Group
- nice silly penguin looking like a cowboy! It was so exciting logo ... we
decided that we couldn't live without it and we wanted to see it 
at boot time as a logo on our secondary monitors. There was a small problem
- Hercules doesn't support color graphics. So we decided to convert the
penguin image to ascii art using netpbm tools.

</P>
<P>
The output was very ugly because the converting algorithm was absolutly stupid.
During the night I designed a new convertor that used a font bitmap to
creat an aproximation table. The output wasn't very good since the algorithm
wasn't tuned so well. Many months this small piece of code was waiting on my
disc for the day "D". Meanwhile I started a new project XaoS (a fractal zoomer)
with my friend Thomas. And then I got an idea: Ascii Art Mandelbrots!
I was really impressed by the result! XaoS was faster, portable and looking
much better than ever before. I found a new way to go ...
