					a Tron Clone in 3d
				</h2>
				<p>
					Armagetron is a multiplayer game in 3d that attempts to emulate and expand on the
					lightcycle sequence from the movie Tron. It's an old school arcade game slung into
					the 21st century. Highlights include a customizable playing arena, HUD, unique graphics,
					and AI bots. For the more advanced player there are new game modes and a wide variety
					of physics settings to tweak as well.

					0.2.9.1 - December 1st, 2020
				</h3>
					<p>This release welcomes our new ultrawide monitor using overlords!</p>
					<p>And, to be frank, also the old, regular widescreen overlords. All this time, the game had been optimized for 4:3 or 5:4 screens, with menu text and HUD elements getting stretched to the side for widescreen users. No more of that! The changes also benefit splitscreen users; for a horizontal split, the HUD will now no longer cover half the (split) screen.</p>
					<p>And while we were at fixing fonts, the default console rendering now tries to display the bitmap font precisely as it is designed, pixel by pixel; that should make the console more readable and sharper looking for everyone.</p>
					<p>Playing back debug recordings has been made simpler and more robust; the --playback command line switch is no longer required and the network code should no longer give up when the recorded server response does not match what the playback code expects. Especially, this version should have no problems playing back tournament recordings made with version 0.2.8.</p>
					<p>What Steam users had for a while is now available for everyone: The onboarding process has been tweaked a little. The intial game is less frustrating, and the tutorial tooltips are spammed less.</p>
					<p>Furthermore, compatibility of the generic Linux binaries has been improved, with more systems supported out of the box.</p>

					<p>Get it from <a href="downloads.php">downloads</a> or, if you're reading this later, the <a href="https://download.armagetronad.org/blog/2020/11/30/build-stable-0.2.9.1.0/">archives<a>.</p>

					<p>The security fixes and build system integration from the 0.2.9 series have been backported into <a href="https://download.armagetronad.org/blog/2020/11/30/build-stable-0.2.8.3.6/">0.2.8.3.6<a>, also available now.</p>
				<h3>
					0.2.9.0 - July 31th, 2020
				</h3>
					<p>We never intended to release a 0.2.9 version, instead the plan was to go directly to 0.4. But 0.4 got stalled, badly. And we had continued improving the
					source on the 0.2.8 branch little by little. Then Covid-19 came around, forcing a lot of people to stay at home, which gave us the motivation
					to release the game on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1306180">Steam</a> and <a href="https://armagetronad.itch.io/armagetronad">itch.io</a>. Thatâ€™s basically why this version exists, so we did not have to publish a 0.2.8.3 based version there.
					But of course, we have to make 0.2.9.0 available for everyone.</p>

					<p>Enjoy! Get it from <a href="downloads.php">downloads</a> or, if you're reading this later, the <a href="https://download.armagetronad.org/blog/2020/07/29/build-stable-0.2.9.0/">archives<a>.</p>

					<p>Major changes since 0.2.8.3 on the game client are better readability for the console output, text input and ingame menu, better initial configuration, keyboard layout reminders
					and an initial, slightly easier match against an AI.</p>

					<p>Major addition on the server are external scripts; they get fed the ladderlog output and their output is parsed as console input. The ladderlog output has been expanded
					to make that feature more useful. Since these scripts are launched as external processes, they can be written in any language.</p>

					<p>We will continue to publish security updates and adaptions to new compilers and Linux versions for the 0.2.8.3 series. Linux distributions with a focus on feature stability
					should stick to that for the time being. We transition softly into a more continuous delivery model with this release, further 0.2.9.X will bring more changes.
					</p>

					<p>PS, August 14th: An update to <a href="https://download.armagetronad.org/blog/2020/08/14/build-stable-0.2.9.0.1/">0.2.9.0.1<a> fixes the AppImage for several Linux distributions.</p>

					Armagetron Advanced about to hit Steam - July 9th, 2020
				</h3>
				<p>
					If all goes according to plan, you will be able to play Armagetron Advanced on Steam as 
					<a href=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1306180/Retrocycles/>Retrocycles</a>. Release date is July 22nd.
					Help it gain early momentum by wishlisting it now!

				<h3>
					0.2.8.3.5 - February 19th, 2020
				</h3>
				<p>
					A security fix release. Head over to <a href="https://download.armagetronad.org/blog/2020/02/20/build-stable-0.2.8.3.5/">the archives</a> to fetch it.
					Also contains fixes to make the game run again on current Linux systems.
				</p>
				<h3>
					0.2.8.3.4 - November 27th, 2016
				</h3>
				<p>
					This release is a compiler compatibility release only; we noticed 0.2.8.3.3 had severe
					problems with gcc 6, all our fault. If you're trying to compile from source,
					go grab the latest <a href="downloads.php"><strong>downloads</strong></a>.
					Users of 0.2.8.3.3 binary builds do not need to hurry.
				</p>
				<h3>
					0.2.8.3.3 - February 28th, 2015
				</h3>
				<p>
					Despite our best attempts at killing it off, we've had to releas another security patch
					for 0.2.8.x. Let us all hope for 0.4.x. It's in the pipeline. Head over to 
					<a href="downloads.php"><strong>downloads</strong></a> to get 0.2.8.3.3 in the meantime.

				<h4>
					Just kidding.
				</h4>
                <p>
                    Apologies to those who briefly got their hopes up. This is not actually a port of
                    Armagetron but rather a clone - a game that looks similar but is actually different.
                    Still, you can enjoy some local Tronning with some friends!

					New bots! - April 1st, 2011
				</h3>
				<p>
					One of the oldest and most annoying features of Armagetron Advanced has been upgraded
					at last. The reason why no one really played until there was a master server. Yes, it's
					the bots. They've been rewritten, from scratch. The bots are now powered by a new
					self-learning algorithm. As you play against them they learn from their mistakes and grow.
				</p>
				<h4>
					Introducing gLATIS
				</h4>
				<p>
					gLATIS - Learning Artifical Tron Intelligence System. (The g comes from the class name.)
					It describes what it does. In the situation where the bot dies it records what was around
					it when it died. Everytime there after when gLATIS reaches a decision point it compares it
					to it's past - or what it's learned - and makes the decision for the best possible outcome.
					If it still dies, well, that's experience for it! (Nothing can go wrong.)
				</p>
				<p>
					Check out this video hilighting gLATIS:

				</h3>
				<p>
					By pass 0.2.8.3, and straight onto bug fixes! There was a bit of a delay getting this
					information posted here. This page suffers from a bit of a bus factor problem. We're

					Loads of things fixed and updated for what will hopefully be the last set of changes

				<h4>
					Other happenings
				</h4>
				<p>
					It's been recently pointed out that the site here's a bit out of date generally, and never
					has much news. So we've updated the site, and I'll point out these two neat things I saw on
					the forums. Graphic artist sinewav came up with the rather brilliant idea of dressing out
					the light cycle as a
					<a href="http://forums.armagetronad.org/viewtopic.php?p=203970#203970">train engine</a>,
					and the walls as carriages. Wrtlprnft added in a floor with tracks, and Jonathan put together
					a cool <a href="http://forums.armagetronad.org/download.php?id=9942">video</a> showing it off.
				</p>
				<p>
					Match Winner ed has also chimed in to show us Armagetron on his homemade
					<a href="http://forums.armagetronad.org/viewtopic.php?p=204030#204030">retro console</a>. It
					looks like it'd be awesome to play. I wonder if the coin loader works? (And is that sombrero
					standard equipment?) Check it out!

					Thanks everyone! - February 17th, 2009
				</h3>
				<p>
					I don't know how to say it, so I'll say it plain. A big, big thanks to everyone that's
					donated these last two weeks. Nearly two-hundred dollars were donated that'll keep us in
					business for the next two years at least. Thanks everyone!

				<h3>
					Donation Drive! Hosting Costs! You can help! - February 5th, 2009
				</h3>
				<p>
					Our hosting is coming up for renewal in two months. This time around, we'd really appreciate
					some help. It's a bit to ask, but we'd like to get $150USD to help us through the next two
					years. http://forums.armagetronad.org/viewtopic.php?t=19025
