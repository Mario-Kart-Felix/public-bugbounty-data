    <h3>A freedb server for RISC OS</h3>

    <p>
      I've designed it so as to allow anyone to write clients to fit on top,
      this way I didn't need to write a CD player. :)
    </p>

    <p>
      There is a <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/acorncddb">mailing list</a> for
      discussion of AcornCD use and development, I shall also post announcements about
      new releases etc. to the list.
    </p>

    <h4>Requirements</h4>

    <p>
      AcornCD requires a fairly recent set of Toolbox modules to run, along with the nested
      Window manager. You can get hold of these from 
      <a href="http://www.riscos.com/">RISC OS Ltd.</a>, on their
      <a href="http://support.riscos.com/Support/Updates/">updates page</a>, the
      <a href="http://support.riscos.com/Support/Updates/Toolbox.zip">Toolbox update zip</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Additionally, if you want to submit freedb entries (you do, honest...), you'll need Justin
      Fletcher's GMail, available from his
      <a href="http://www.movspclr.co.uk/software.html#gmail">software page</a>.
    </p>

    <h4>Recent changes</h4>

    08/09/2003:
    <p>
    I've released a 32-bit patch archive on Sourceforge, available on the
    <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=27072">
      files page
    </a>. It includes the !Run and !RunImages for
    !AcornCD and !CdTester, which are now built 32-bit.
    <p>
    Copy these files over your current applications, and you'll be able
    to run on a 32-bit capable platform, which includes a 26-bit system
    with the new shared C library.

    <hr width="50%">

    I've released AcornCD as "Open Source" on Sourceforge, you can visit the
    <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/acorncd/">project home page</a>.
    <a href="#downloads">Downloads</a> are now stored on the Sourceforge site.

    <hr width="50%">

    09/05/2001 - Release 14:
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>
        AcornCD now uses freedb! I've finally seen the light and turned my back on CDDB, they no
        longer care about CDDB (only CDDB2), have stupid licencing conditions etc. etc.
      </li>
      <li>
        AcornCD now internally has all the code to support queued requests, just no method to
        actually go about queueing things, and no code to empty the queue. Considering putting
        my code on SourceForge and open sourcing it...I don't have enough time to work on it
        really.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <hr width="50%">

    <a href="#spec">Specification download</a> is now a zip file, containing a StrongHelp manual
    for the AcornCD interface, gratefully received from Matthew Somerville.  Developer download
    includes StrongHelp manual also.

    <hr width="50%">

    Updated <a href="#spec">specification</a> a bit, adding a little bit of text for the new
    "hello" and "get id" messages.

    <hr width="50%">

    16/02/2000 - Release 13:
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Fixed AcornCD sprites for app and test harness.  Filer sprites are now the correct
        size.  Thanks go to Stuart Halliday for providing the nicer sprite. :)
      </li>
    </ul>

    <hr width="50%">

    21/01/2000 - Release 12:
    <br>
    Added some functionality to the client->server interface requested by client
    developers, namely:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Added the ability to be able to send a "hello" message to AcornCD to see if it's running.
        The test harness sends this message on start-up now, but does nothing if it
        discovers AcornCD isn't running.
      </li>
      <li>
        Also added a "Get CDDB ID" interface, so that a client app can get the CDDB ID of a disc
        in a drive without doing the calculation themselves.  Added new button to test
        harness which uses this new ID request mechanism, so you can see an example of its use.
      </li>
    </ul>
    Note:<br>
    These two new interfaces are shown
    in the <a href="#spec">specification</a>, and included in the developer
    release.  There's not much flowery English there, so if you don't "get it" I can prolly
    help you understand if you email me. :)

    <hr width="50%">

    03/12/1999 - Release 11:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Revamped AcornCD sprites for server and test harness.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <hr width="50%">

    10/11/1999 - Release 10:
    <ul>
      <li>
        AcornCDDB has been renamed to AcornCD on the request of Escient, the owners of
        the CDDB&trade; trademark.
        The only changes in this release are to do with this name change.  The
        documentation has been updated, the apps now call themselves different names, and
        a few more &trade;s have been liberally strewn about.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <hr width="50%">

    23/08/1999 - Release 9:
    <ul>
      <li>
        A few bug fixes...default key handlers are now registered in both !CDDB
        and !CdTest, so you'll no longer find you've lost keyboard shortcuts like Control-F12.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fixed wimp message interface for handling of local-only CDBB lookups, the
        client will receive a message back from the lookup no matter what.  Note to
        Developers: This change also added a new result code to the "QueryResults"
        message, "LocalCDDBError".  This is returned if AcornCDDB has problems accessing
        its local CDDB.  See the updated specification for the result code.
      </li>
      <li>
        Added new option for submission of CDDB entries using GMail.  AcornCDDB will now
        use direct SMTP only if a choices option is set, otherwise it will use GMail's 
        default action, which is to use the spool directory it finds on the user's system,
        i.e. ANTSuite, FreeSMTP etc.  You'll get a warning if you start up AcornCDDB with
        your old choices file, just open up the Choices dialogue and resave your options.
      </li>
      <li>
        Renamed debug versions of !Runs and !RunImages, they are now called !RunD and !RunImageD.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <hr width="50%">

    30/07/1999 - Release 8:
    <ul>
      <li>
        AcornCDDB has <b>finally</b> been verified to do submissions to the Internet
        CDDB&trade; and is now allowed to do so.  So, this release enables remote
        submission of CDDB entries.  AcornCDDB uses
        <a href="http://www.movspclr.co.uk/software.html#gmail">GMail</a> to send the
        submissions by email, so you will need to install and configure GMail.  At the
        moment the only GMail method AcornCDDB uses is the direct SMTP method, so I
        need to talk to GMail's author to see if there's a way to make this configurable.
        So, I've got a release I'd actually call quite complete,
        <a href="#downloads">go get it</a>.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4><a name="downloads">Downloads</a></h4>

    Downloads are available on the
    <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=27072">Sourceforge file list</a>
    page, along with release notes.

    What you'll find there:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>User release</b> - this is probably what you want, contains just the AcornCD server, to
        allow AcornCD-capable clients to fetch CD info off freedb servers.
      </li>
      <li>
        Developer release - this is for developers, and include the AcornCD server, a test harness
        client (including the source code of this, for now) and the documentation.  This
        release shouldn't really be necessary any more, seeing all the source is in CVS now.
      </li>
      <li><a name="spec"></a>
        Specification - Specification of the interface between the AcornCD server and any
        client application. Saves you downloading the developer release or checking the
        docs out of CVS.
      </li>
      <li>
        Example submission code - some example C code I posted ages ago for creating a dynamic
        area that holds an AcornCD database entry for use in submitting entries to AcornCD using
        the wimp message interface.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <hr width="50%">

    Additionally, <a href="acorncd-nightly.tar.gz">a nightly tarball</a>
    of the source is available, for those of you who want the latest and greatest, but have
    problems using CVS.
