Version 0.1 of The Bowling Database/Statistics Managment has just been 
released.  BD/SM is written in PHP, and uses MySQL.  It stores games for 
each user of the system, and tracks detailed statistics.  While users 
enter their games from the comfort of a web browser Javascript creates 
real-time scoring.  Please check out this release, you might even find 
out interesting things about your bowling habits.  Go right ahead to the 
downloads page of our <a

We are rapidly hurtling tword our first release(0.1).  This release will essentially be SVN revision 23.  What is currently holding us back is documentation for setting the database up on your own system.  I'm a bit tied up at work right now, so that documentation is probably about two weeks in the offing.
