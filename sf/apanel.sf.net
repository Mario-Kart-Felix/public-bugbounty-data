<p>The notebook Fujitsu C-4110 lifebook has an application panel (if you
want to know what it is, look at
<a href="http://www.fujitsu-pc.com/www/support.shtml?support/techspecs/notebooks/cseriessum99_info">Fujitsu C-4110 description</a>).
This works in windows, but what if you want to use it from another operating
system? Since Fujitsu wasn't very helpful in this respect, I had to find it
out myself.</p>

<p>I found out some i/o sequences that could be implemented in drivers
for other platforms. After some time, the i/o sequences appeared
looked a lot like smbus commands and after trying it out on my laptop, 
the new <a href="tech.php">technical details</a> were written, as well as a new
driver which should support most models. After that specs for some of
the ic's used were found, wich enabled the creation of an interrupt-driven
driver. A <a href="stuff/">pre-alpha test version</a> showed, however,
that this was too unreliable to use because of ghost keystrokes.</p>

<p>Go to the <a href="download.php">download page</a> to download the
drivers. Currently, FreeBSD and linux are supported. Of course it's all
open-source.</p>
<p>I want to thank Martijn Coenen en Leon Schrijvers for their 
<a href="http://kyathos.penguinpowered.com/tlp/index.html">TLP Project</a>
(site dead) with which it all started, and Jochen Eisinger for writing the
linux driver.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: this project has been silent for a couple of years
already and isn't likely to be revived since the hardware has become too old to
be widely used. The drivers and documentation remain available on this
website.</p>
