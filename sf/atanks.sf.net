<li><b>11/02/2016</b> - Atomic Tanks 6.5<br>
We have released a very minor update to Atomic Tanks which addresses
a number of build issues. This version of Atomic Tanks should work with
reproducible builds. No game play changes have been made for this release.
<br><br><br>

<li><b>12/21/2015</b> - Atomic Tanks 6.4<br>
We are happy to announce a new release of Atomic Tanks is now available for
download. The new release, version 6.4, carries a number of bug fixes and minor
improvements. Perhaps the most visual change is more funky behaviour in the funky
bombs and the AI players handle napalm better.
<br><br><br>

<li><b>08/01/2015</b> - Atomic Tanks 6.3<br>
We are pleased to announce the launch of Atomic Tanks 6.3. The new version is a
major overhaul from past releases. The new version includes a lot of improved
code and was made with the hard work of developer Sven. The latest release of
Atanks fixes many stability issues, offers a a snappier menu system and the AI is
better at buying and aiming. (So be careful out there!)
<br><br>
Sven has also improved unicode support, added more in-code documentation and
explosions make bits of dirt and debris fly around. As a bonus, it should
now be easier to compile Atanks on Windows. You can get the latest release
from our download page.
<br><br><br>


<li><b>05/26/2015</b> - Windows build of Atomic Tanks 6.2<br>
Billy Buerger has kindly put together a Windows build of Atomic Tanks 6.2. It can
be downloaded directly using <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/atanks/files/atanks/atanks-6.2/atanks-6.2-windows.exe/download">this link</a>. Please note Buerger
reports the Windows version of Atanks may offer poor performance on Windows 10,
but has been found to work properly on Windows 7 and Windows 8.
<br><br><br>

<li><b>04/05/2015</b> - Atomic Tanks 6.2<br>
We are pleased to announce a new version of Atomic Tanks. This release
mostly contains bug fixes and optimizations. People playing Atanks should
find the Options screen cleaner and more stable, less prone to displaying
random characters. A lot of code clean up has happened too, thanks to the
efforts of Bruno Victal and Daniel Gutson.
<br><br>
People building Atanks from source code should find the process produces
fewer warnings and a reduction in code size should make the process a
little faster.
<br><br><br>
<li><b>12/16/2014</b> - Atomic Tanks 6.1<br>
Billy Buerger very kindly did some work on Atomic Tanks and we are very happy to
share his improvements with all of you. The latest version of Atomic Tanks
now features an in-round scoreboard so you can see who is winning and what
order the players will take their turns. The scoreboard can be turned on/off
by using the "~" key. Other improvements include smoother turn switching,
rollers weapons react properly when hitting steel walls and games where
the AI is playing itself go on for a full minute instead of just ten seconds.
Plus, navigating the store/buying screen should work better now when using
the keyboard.
<br><br>
Many thanks to Billy Buerger for all these improvements. Pleasant
tank commanding and happy holidays, everyone!
<br><br><br>
<li><b>06/24/2014</b> - Atomic Tanks 6.0 for Windows<br>
With many thanks to Daniel Ford for putting in all the hard work, we
are happy to announce Atomic Tanks 6.0 now runs on Windows. It has been
a while since we had a native Windows build and we are grateful to
Daniel for putting together this port of Atomic Tanks for Windows. You
can find a copy of Atanks for Windows by following the Downloads link
to the left of this page.
<br><br><br>

<li><b>06/01/2014</b> - Atomic Tanks release 6.0<br>
We are happy to announce the availablility of a new version of Atomic Tanks.
Atanks 6.0 contains a few bug fixes which should improve stability and reduce
memory leakage. We have also added a new feature. During battle rounds
the player can press "v" to decrease audio volume and "V" (shift+v) to
increase volume. Thanks to Sven and Daniel for providing the bulk of
the work in this release.
<br><br><br>


<li><b>03/29/2014</b> - Atomic Tanks release 5.9<br>
This latest version of Atomic Tanks patches a few minor issues and should make
the game more stable, especially when dealing with networked games. The fixes in
this release are due to the kind contributions of Daniel Gutson.

<br><br><br>

<li><b>01/27/2014</b> - Atomic Tanks release 5.8<br>
This new version of Atanks is a bug fix release. For the past year we have had reports
of Atanks crashing at random times or when changing settings in the Options screen. This
problem has been traced back to the way newer versions of the GNU compiler handle
optimizations. We have included a work around for this issue and squashed a few other
bugs in the process. No new features are available in 5.8, this is a bug-fix release only.
<br><br><br>

<li><b>10/26/2012</b> - Atomic Tanks release 5.7<br>
This new release features a new tank type, the Mini. This
little tank and its turrent have a small, classic look to them. This
version also includes a fix for the Option menu crash. Versions
of Atanks built with the GNU C++ compiler (version 4.7) would
crash when accessing the Options screen and this has been corrected.
<br><br>
There are some cases where menu items may show the incorrect text
for the option, but this happens rarely and we are working to fix
it for the next release, along with some new improvements.
<br><br><br>

<li><b>09/18/2012</b> - Atomic Tanks release 5.6<br>
A few minor problems were addressed in this release. A bug
which could cause Atanks to crash during network play was fixed,
licensing information was updated. The game should now compile
properly on Windows (and other platforms where pthreads is not
supported). A number of compiler warnings were cleaned up so the
game now builds cleanly using Clang 3.0.<br>
<br>
One issue we have not been able to fix is a crash which
occurs while accessing the Options screen. For some reason
this only happens with copies of Atanks build on the Fedora Linux
distribution. We have confirmed Atanks does not build cleanly
on Fedora. This results in either an error during the build process or
corrupted memory when running Atanks. However, we are not sure 
of the exact cause. Atanks continues
to build properly on every other Linux distribution we have
tested, FreeBSD and other platforms. If you get Atanks running
on Fedora, please let us know how so we can apply the fix for everyone.
<br><br>
<b>Update:</b> We believe the problem is the way in which some
variables are declared in Atanks and how the GNU C++ complier
(version 4.7) handles them. For now, the work around is to either
build Atanks with an older version of GCC (version 4.6 is known
to work) or use the Clang compiler. A proper fix for Atanks is
being tested at the moment and Atomic Tanks 5.7 will include
this fix to insure the game builds with the latest version of
the GNU C++ compiler. Special thanks to Jon, Neil, Fabian and
Ansgar for helping to track down the issue, patch it and run
tests.
<br><br><br>

<li><b>05/17/2012</b> - Atomic Tanks release 5.5<br>
A small bug has been found in the Atomic Tanks makefiles.
The bug was discovered and fixed by Ville. This is
the only update to Atanks in 5.5.<br>
<br><br>

<li><b>04/08/2012</b> - Atomic Tanks release 5.4<br>
We have a minor update to Atomic Tanks to present. This
release, 5.4, updates the Portuguese language files and
corrects some out of date documentation in the Russian
README file. This release also applies a patch from the
Gentoo distribution which should correct a few build
issues. This is a bug-fix release and there are no new
game features in 5.4.
<br><br><br>
<li><b>02/23/2012</b> - Atomic Tanks release 5.3<br>
A new update is available for Atomic Tanks. This release,
version 5.3, is mostly a bug-fix release with some performance
improvements. A number of memory leaks have been fixed, some
un-needed variables were removed, some performance tuning was
done. Work has been done to make Atanks more thread safe than
it was before, which should make future development easier.
Almost all of this work was volunteered by Nathan Mills who sent
in many useful (and well documented) patches. Thank you, Nathan!
<br>
<br>
We are still looking for someone to take over development on
a more full-time basis. If you're interested in getting involved,
please <a href="mailto:jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca">e-mail me</a>.
<br><br><br>
<li><b>10/06/2011</b> - The forum:<br>
<br>
Over the past few months the Atomic Tanks forum has been hit by an
increasing amount of spam. Since the forum is hardly ever used
anymore and since we're not getting hit by dozens of spam message
each day, the forum is being abondoned. We just don't have time to
keep up with the inflow of garbage anymore.<br>
<br>
Should you wish to report a bug, send feedback, submit patches,
translations or ask for help, please do so by contacting
<a href="mailto:jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca">jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca</a>.
<br><br><br>

<li><b>10/03/2011</b> - We have another minor update available. This
release, version 5.2, fixes a few issues with the make/build/install
process used by Atomic Tanks and improves the desktop icon on Linux
systems. Game play should not be affected by these changes, so if Atanks
is working fine for you, there isn't any need to upgrade to 5.2. This
is a release to help packagers.

<br><br><br>

<li><b>06/30/2011</b> - There is now a minor update available which
improves upon the close butotn behaviour of the 5.0 release. The 5.1
version will now close faster (skipping any remaining rounds). The close
button should now also work properly if it is clicked during Demo Mode.
<br><br><br>

<li><b>06/04/2011</b> - There is a new version of Atomic Tanks available for
download. This version, 5.0, is a minor bug fix release. The window's
close button didn't work on the buying or during rounds and that
has been fixed.<br>
<br><br>

<li><b>04/16/2011</b> - The new release of Atomic Tanks, version 4.9, is
ready for download. This is a minor update from 4.8 and the only major change
is the inclusion of a new Italian translation, provided by Roby Alice.
<br><br>
<br>

<li><b>03/06/2011</b> - Atomic Tanks, version 4.8, is ready for download. This release fixes a few bugs. Specifically SDI lasers now fire in the correct direction, demo mode has been fixed and AI players can no longer buy weapons above their tech level.<br>
<br>

for BSD users, including OS X. It's a work in progress, but I hope to have
better support the BSD family in the upcoming 4.6 version. Until then, we
have a token for PC-BSD users, a PBI package which should work on PC-BSD 8.

and a Windows build at the same time. Thanks to BillyBuerger for making this possible.<br>
<br><br>
On another note, the project is looking for people who can help make Atomic Tanks even
better. Can you translate text into another language? Can you draw? How about convert
