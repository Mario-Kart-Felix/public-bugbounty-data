Welcome to BandwidthD's home page! 
<br>
<br>
BandwidthD tracks usage of TCP/IP network subnets and builds html files with 
graphs to display utilization. Charts are built by individual IPs, and
by default display utilization over 2 day, 8 day, 40 day, and 400 day periods. 
Furthermore,  each ip address's utilization can be logged out at intervals
of 3.3 minutes, 10 minutes, 1 hour or 12 hours in cdf format, or to a
backend database server. HTTP, TCP, UDP, ICMP, VPN, and P2P traffic are color coded.
<br><br>
BandwidthD runs on most platforms including windows. Required libraries for
unix are only: libpcap, libgl and libpng.  
<br>
<br>
Most of the info you're looking for is on the 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/bandwidthd">SourceForge project page</a>.  At SourceForge we keep 
all new releases, the bug tracker and the support forums.
<br>
<br>
Bandwidthd now produces output in 2 ways.  The first is as a standalone
application that produces static html and png output every 200 seconds.  The
second is as a sensor that transmits it's data to a backend database which
is then reported on by dynamic php pages.  The visual output of both is
simular, but the database driven system allows for searching, filtering, multiple
sensors and custom reports.<br>
<br>
Here are some screenshots of the dynamic version.<br>

We also have an <a href=demo>example</a> of the static version.  
We have copied the BandwidthD html directory from an isp and
posted it here.  Please take a moment to inspect it's output.  The output is frozen
in time. It represents a copy made on Jan 15, 2004. This should convey what
BandwidthD currently produces.<br>
