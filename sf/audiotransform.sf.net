	 <H4>Audiotransform Status Update [October 3, 2003]</H4>
	 <p>
	 Not much has happened in cvs in the last three weeks
	 or so.  But fear not, work has continued.  I took a short break
	 and stepped back from the project to contemplate where it stands
	 its flaws and the direction it will go.
	 </p>
	 <p>
	 A number of changes will take place before the next release
	of audiotransform and I appoligize for the delay.  I know that the motto is 
	release early and often but I like to release stuff that works too.
	 </p>
	 <H4>Audiotransform 0.1.4 stable release [August 15, 2003]</H4>
	 <p>
	 This is the first stable release and sports a number of new
	 features although not completely mature, it is getting closer.
	 Audiotransform now has full support for WAV, AU and AIFF files
	 through Sox and/or libsndfile.  Including reading and writing with
	 different encodings such as [signed linear, unsigned linear, 
	 GSM, ADPCM, IMA ADPCM, MS ADPCM, A-law, U-law and more!!!].
	 This release also has a ton of bug fixes and supports drag
	 and drop for ease of use.
	 </p>
	 <p>
	 This program depends heavily on <B>you</B>.  I would love to 
	 hear that you are using the program and more importantly, I
	 would love to know about any bugs that you can find
	 or features that you would like to see in 0.1.5.  I know I
	 am excited about adding support for mp3 and ogg in 0.1.5.
	 But please, tell me what you think!
	 </p>
	 <p>Thanks,<br />
	 Russ</p>
